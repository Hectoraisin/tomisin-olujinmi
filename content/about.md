### Hello! Welcome to my personal website. 

My name is Tomisin and I am a B2B SaaS Copywriter. I have worked for MakeUseOf and CNX Software, writing long-form and news articles about productivity, electronics and computer hardware, embedded technology, and artificial intelligence. I write fiction occasionally and might publish a book or two in the near future.

Currently, I create thoughtful and audience-oriented content for decision makers and stakeholders in the B2B SaaS industry. I write newsletters, landing pages, email copy, ebooks, blog posts, articles, and whitepapers. 

I am a fitness enthusiast, repented gamer, and so-so programmer. I love to tinker with software, especially open-source software, and I never cease to be amazed with what it is possible with code, 

You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomisin-olujinmi/) or send me an email via the contact form below:
