### Hello and Welcome! 

My name is Tomisin and I love writing stories. I have a degree in agricultural extension and communication technology from the (Federal University of Technology Akure.

I have worked for MakeUseOf and CNX Software, writing long-form articles and news stories about productivity, electronics and computer hardware, embedded technology, and artificial intelligence. I write fiction and might publish a book or two in the near future, if the world doesn't end before.

I am a fitness enthusiast and a sucker for aesthetics. I love open-source software, and I never cease to be amazed with what it is possible with code. Currently, I write news and other stories for [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io)

You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomisin-olujinmi/) or send me an email via the contact form below:
