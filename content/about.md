### Hello! Welcome to my personal website. 

My name is Tomisin and I am a writer. I have worked for MakeUseOf and CNX Software, writing long-form and news articles about productivity, electronics and computer hardware, embedded technology, and artificial intelligence. I also love writing fiction but who doesn't. 

Apart from writing, I am a fitness enthusiast, repented gamer, and so-so programmer. I make up for my lack of programming ability with a can-do attitude and writing wit. 

I have written content for the World Wide Web for over three years now and I have been around the block enough to know what I like and what really grinds my gears. This is where I share my thoughts about digital technology, online marketing, and life as I see it. 

You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomisin-olujinmi/) or send me an email via the contact form below:
