summary: Why I used Hugo to create my personal website
---

A personal  website is digital real estate. Having a domain name and hosting grants you your own tiny cranny of the Internet that you can completely lord over. Unlike a social media account, you can’t be de-platformed and you don’t really have to deal with people you don’t like. Everyone, I believe, should have at least a blog on their website. It is a plus if the website is self-hosted (although mine isn't).

WordPress is the most popular option for people who want to build their own website and it is a great option. It is free, powerful, and quite customizable. However, it is overkill for most purposes. For my website, I decided to forego a traditional content management system like WordPress and opt for a static site generator instead.

A static website is easier and cheaper to host, offers a lot of granularity, and generally loads faster than a comparable dynamic website. Popular static site generators include Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, and Astro.

My first choice was Jekyll but I couldn't find suitable documentation and it all seemed unwieldy. So, I decided to go with Hugo instead. Hugo is a static site generator written in the Go language. It is indisputably the fastest SSG on the market. 

Hugo requires three dependencies: Git, Go, and Sass. I have been spoiled by Windows operating system and I had to get used to working in the terminal. With some Googling, grit, and a little help from Perplexity, I started to get the hang of it. 

I installed the dependencies and by following the instructions in the Quickstart tutorial, I got my first static website up and running. Configuring the website involves changing the default settings in the hugo.toml (or yaml) file and adding new values. I added a theme, wrote some pages, and started writing this post -- my very first post on my personal website. 

I have learnt to use git commits to track changes and “back up” my website. I have also brushed my rusty HTML wrangling skills a bit and I understand the Jamstack appeal now.

The website isn’t complete yet but I am very happy with where it is currently and look forward to bringing my vision to life.
