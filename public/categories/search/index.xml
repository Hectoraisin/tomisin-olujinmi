      <title>The Problem With AI Overviews</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to Search Engine Land, AI Oveviews appear in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-ai-overviews-found-in-74-of-problem-solving-queries/538504/&#34;   target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;74% of “problem-solving” queries&lt;/a&gt;
. They have taken over from featured snippets as Google’s latest attempt at keeping users on the SERP with zero-click searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI Overviews have become much better than when they first launched but I still think they are net negative on the search experience and are better off hidden away in a collapsible drop-down menu like People Also Ask.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Who Ruined Search?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google displaced other search engines by leveraging a simple, minimalistic interface and superior search algorithm. While its competitors were cluttered, ad-ridden web portals, Google had one specific purpose, and it did it well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was what Google looked like then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Google&amp;rsquo;s search results interface in 2011&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/who-ruined-search/google-search-2011-serp.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://search.googleblog.com/2011/06/some-updates-to-design-of-search.html&#34;   target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Search Blog&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Google’s search engine is partly an AI chatbot and partly a portal to Reddit. Ads are displayed prominently above the fold. The top search results are fluffy, long-form content ranking primarily because of the number of keywords and backlinks on the page. Despite the company&amp;rsquo;s best efforts to convince us otherwise, Google cannot reliably infer content quality. Therefore, the algorithm has to make do with other less important and more easily faked signals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
