[{"content":"A B2B SaaS landing page is a focused, standalone web page designed to convert business (B2B) prospects into leads or customers for a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product. It is part of a specific marketing campaign (social, email, or search) and encourages visitors to take a single, targeted action.\nIt is a proven fact that landing pages are better for conversions than websites. Even if your product’s value proposition is laid out perfectly on your homepage and it fits the ad campaign, you should still use a landing page. Why? Unlike your homepage, a landing page (ideally) has one jumping off point: the call-to-action.\nAn oft-touted statistic from Unbounce says that they checked 455 pages and found that, on average, a dedicated landing page has a 65 percent higher conversion rate than website pages. We have no further information about the study though.\nA detailed case study by Instapage concluded that a dedicated landing page had a conversion rate almost three times (~300%) of a homepage, despite having a lower click-through rate.\nA B2B landing page’s primary purpose is to convert visitors into leads or customers with a promise. Therefore, a dedicated landing page often means higher conversions.\nElements of a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page All landing pages do not convert equally. Just like your software product needs to meet certain requirements, a landing page needs certain elements to be effective:\nPromise: A good landing page must offer a specific promise. This promise must be clear to the audience and address the exact problem they want to solve. Source: Shopify For example, the above landing page by Shopify promises lower costs and business growth. It communicates its message with few words and an eye-catching design.\nThe best B2B SaaS landing pages also have a hero image/section that shows the product in action. The prospect should be able to see themselves using your product’s features and getting results. In practice, this might be a screenshot of the software interface, a picture/illustration of a satisfied user, or a video explaining the benefits of the product. Actual pictures of people using the product are often more powerful.\nSource: Hubstaff Pictures of people tend to be more emotionally appealing than illustrations and visualizations. Research has shown that relevant images of real people can lead to a 95% increase in conversion rates .\nProof: Proof is also vital for a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page. It shows the prospect that you can deliver on the promise. The landing page should have hard numbers and testimonials that communicate your brand’s value. You are leaving money on the table without social proof. Source: Strikingly It is hard to sell a prospect who doesn’t trust you. Your proof should be prominently placed on the landing page, second only to your call to action.\nPull: A strong pull complements the previous two elements. You need an interesting lead magnet and a well-placed call-to-action button. Not every B2B landing page needs a lead magnet, though. If you offer a free trial and/or don’t request for credit card information at sign up, that is the lead magnet.\nSource: Wix canonicalURL: https://tomisinolujinmi.com/posts/who-ruined-search Your lead capture form should be simple and conducive to a frictionless signup. In some cases (enterprise SaaS, especially), you should collect enough information to qualify the lead effectively. If you have a product that has a long sales cycle, asking for just an email address might attract low-quality leads.\nThe goal is to reduce friction without affecting lead quality. You can skip the email funnel entirely and go straight to the sign up and onboarding process.\nBest practices for designing a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page Having the above elements in your landing page doesn’t guarantee that your conversion rates will go through the roof. To make a great meal, it is not enough to have the right ingredients. You need to have them in the right proportion.\nHere is a list of what it takes to create a high-converting landing page for a B2B SaaS audience\n1. Navigation is a no-no Navigation blurs the line between a landing page and a regular website page. It dilutes attention and weakens the emphasis of your campaign. While some big names do it, it is not a recommended practice.\nSource: Quickbooks A landing page should ideally have one link on it – the call-to-action. This is why you should never send traffic to your homepage and why having a dedicated landing page for each campaign cannot be overemphasized.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude a top navigation bar on the landing page Include a YouTube video (distracting and provides a click-away point) Have more than one call-to-action Do:\nHave a single call-to-action Use Wistia for demo videos, if needed Provide all relevant information on the landing page itself 2. Responsiveness and speed are not negotiable Source: Carrd A good landing page loads fast and looks good on all devices. In 2024, Unbounce carried out a study of over 40000 landing pages and found out that 79% of SaaS landing page visits came from mobile devices.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness.

A good B2B landing page should focus on two parties: you and your target customer.\nSource: Zoho Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re at a high-end restaurant and instead of giving you the menu and letting you choose what you\u0026rsquo;d like to eat, the waiter starts talking about how this restaurant is much better than the one down the street. You\u0026rsquo;d probably encourage him to give you the menu and let you come to your own conclusion. It\u0026rsquo;s the same thing with selling B2B SaaS products.\nMost prospects don\u0026rsquo;t care about who you\u0026rsquo;re better than; they just want to get the best value.\nWhile there are no studies on the performance of AI-generated vs human-written copy, a landing page is no place, in my opinion, for the generic content LLMs are known for. AI-assisted copy is generally fine, as long as it feels personal and retains your tone of voice.\n4. A/B testing Always Be Testing. A/B testing, also known as split testing, tests two different versions of a page to see which performs best. With A/B testing, you can tweak different elements on your B2B SaaS landing page (headlines, product images, calls-to-action, etc) and see what makes a difference in overall conversions.\nHowever, be cautious of being hyper-focused on minor details at the expense of the big picture. The majority of copy and design choices will be driven by gut feeling, personal taste, and experience.\nA/B tests should be concentrated on the parts of the landing page that directly influence conversions: copy length, headlines, form fields, call-to-action and key visuals.\nThere are no set rules for A/B testing though.

They have taken over from featured snippets as Google’s latest attempt at keeping users on the SERP with zero-click searches.\nAI Overviews have become much better than when they first launched but I still think they are net negative on the search experience and are better off hidden away in a collapsible drop-down menu like People Also Ask.\nThat pretty much sums up my thoughts on AI Overviews. But, do read on if you want to know why I have a gripe with AI overviews:\n1. They are not better than featured snippets AI Overviews feel like a poorly thought-out solution to a problem that doesn’t exist. It is a perfect example of a solution looking for a problem.\nSource: Ben Collins (X) Google already displayed featured snippets prominently at the top of SERPs and while webmasters complained for a while, it was generally seen as the cost of doing business with a profit-driven conglomerate. Google has now replaced the passable featured snippets with slower and far less accurate AI Overviews. It is a downgrade on several levels. I never thought I would miss featured snippets but here we are.\nGoogle Search has become a sorry state of affairs with AI-generated summaries of AI-generated content.\n2. The overviews are scraped content The root of the problem is Google’s decision to compete with publishers for clicks and traffic, similar to most social media platforms.\nGoogle went from being a search engine that allowed people to find interesting websites and articles to scraping the content and publishing it on their SERPs directly. Some people would argue web crawling and web scraping are completely different but I’d argue that there is only a fine distinction.\nGoogle didn’t become a web scraping service until it introduced schema markups which enhanced user experience but blurred the line between the publisher and the medium. They followed up with weather updates and live sports scores before going all in with featured snippets.\nGoogle has been scraping content and stealing traffic from publishers for a while. It is different now because AI Overviews only benefit the company and not the users.\nSoon, Google might stop showing websites entirely and simply display complete articles scraped from different sources .\n3. They are on by default I would be far less bothered with AI Overviews if Google made it easy to turn them off completely.\nThere is the Web (or “udm-14) workaround popularized by Ernie Smith of Tedium, but there is no official setting from Google that allows you to hide AI Overviews from searches across all devices.\nThe official reason is that Google knows what you want better than you do .\nAI Overviews always felt like a feature that Google was pressured to include. For the first time in the history of search, another search engine beat Google to the punch leveraging AI – technology that was a core part of Google’s business. The top guns panicked and had the teams push out a feature that was not close to being ready.\nIt is not exactly groundbreaking technology but it is enough to keep the movers and shakers happy. Turning it off would imply that Google was wrong to include in the first place and egos tend to fly sky high when you are as large as Google.\nTen blue links, how I\u0026rsquo;ve missed you\nThe “Web” results view is unburdened with AI results, for now. You can get a clean list of results by selecting Web from the menu at the bottom of the search bar or by adding “\u0026amp;udm-14” to the search URL. Ernie’s original blog post shows you how to set it up in your browser. TenBlueLinks and Ernie’s udm14 website can also be used as custom search engines. Enjoy it while it lasts.\nTip: You can add -ai to your search query for a quick fix\nSince the fiasco with the rocks and glue eating, Google has been more cautious with displaying AI Overviews. I’ve noticed AI Overviews appear more in informational searches and are less present in searches related to medicine (soon to be changed , finance, and politics. Due to how LLMs work, overviews also do not appear for breaking news or trending content.

While its competitors were cluttered, ad-ridden web portals, Google had one specific purpose, and it did it well.\nThis was what Google looked like then:\nSource: Google Search Blog Today, Google’s search engine is partly an AI chatbot and partly a portal to Reddit. Ads are displayed prominently above the fold. The top search results are fluffy, long-form content ranking primarily because of the number of keywords and backlinks on the page. Despite the company\u0026rsquo;s best efforts to convince us otherwise, Google cannot reliably infer content quality. Therefore, the algorithm has to make do with other less important and more easily faked signals.\nSince businesses started getting on the Web, it has been a dance between Google and SEOs with each end trying to get the better of the other. Google would release a new algorithm update and SEO experts would try to reverse-engineer it based on their observations and opinions.\nThese observations would become tactics and strategies, and if you had a website that relied on getting traffic from Google, you had to pay attention. Occasionally, Google would release a guide with some helpful tips and some intentionally vague advice like “Make your site interesting and useful.” The company encouraged search engine optimization, as long as you didn\u0026rsquo;t game the system. However, the simple truth is, that if there is a loophole, people will try to exploit it.\nSource: Google\u0026rsquo;s SEO Starter Guide There have several SEO techniques over the years, ranging from straight keyword stuffing to image tags. However, the most prevalent by far has been publishing long-form content. SEOs figured out that the most reliable way to rank high on Google was to write the best article on the topic.\nIt became common to see 2000+ word articles trying to cover every possible search intent with semantic keywords and unnecessary FAQ lists. Recipe pages would include long stories to convince the search algorithm that their content was the most in-depth and relevant. And the worst part (or best, depending on who you ask) is that it worked!\nIt worked because Google was too busy trying to keep the audience’s attention on the increasingly visible ads on the SERPs to ensure that webmasters were writing content for people and not their algorithm.\nBefore the Helpful Content update, if you wrote a 3000-word article filled with semantic keywords and attention-grabbing images/videos, your article was guaranteed to rank. If your competitors caught up to you, you would add more words. Rinse and repeat.\nThe system ran on for a while. A good number of web content writers got paid by the word and were incentivized to write more words. Businesses got to rank on the first page of Google, so they had no reason to change what worked. SEO experts and service providers were able to create a bloated and overpriced industry. But web users were getting the short end of the stick with fluffy, uninteresting, and arduous-to-read content that had forgotten who it was meant to serve.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t explicitly blame SEOs for the turn of events. Behind the scenes, Google has been focused on solving one problem: maximizing profit potential from ad revenue. Google was too busy stealing answers with featured snippets (later AI Overviews) from creators to notice the growing attention issue they had contributed to.\nAs early as 2019, savvy users discovered that adding ‘site:reddit.com’ or simply ‘Reddit’ to their searches was the best way to skip the ads and 2500-word articles to get the actual answer they were looking for. Perhaps if they had the resources, Reddit Inc. could have created a worthwhile competitor to Google Search. Google would later add a ‘Discussions and forums’ section in late 2022 and would begin boosting Reddit and Quora in 2023.\nIn his popular piece \"The Man Who Killed Google Search\", Ed Zitron posits a name he believes was responsible for the current of search: Prabhakar Raghavan. However, I am inclined to disagree. Scapegoats are very easy to find and the real problem likely runs much deeper. Let\u0026rsquo;s see who is behind that mask\nAt the end of the day, Google itself ruined Google Search, and the company has no current incentive to fix it.\nSo, what can we do about it? We can start by using Google\u0026rsquo;s proprietary products less, writing helpful content for people and promoting it actively. You can go a step further and install a custom ROM (LineageOS and /e/OS are good options) on your Android device to shake things up a bit. Between us and the LLM chatbots, I\u0026rsquo;d wager that we could go some damage to the conglomerate.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/who-ruined-search/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eGoogle displaced other search engines by leveraging a simple, minimalistic interface and superior search algorithm.

Having a domain name and hosting grants you your own tiny cranny of the Internet that you can completely lord over. Unlike a social media account, you can’t be de-platformed and you don’t really have to deal with people you don’t like. Everyone, I believe, should have at least a blog on their website. It is a plus if the website is self-hosted (although mine isn\u0026rsquo;t).\nWordPress is the most popular option for people who want to build their own website and it is a great option. It is free, powerful, and quite customizable. However, it is overkill for most purposes. For my website, I decided to forego a traditional content management system like WordPress and opt for a static site generator instead.\nA static website is easier and cheaper to host, offers a lot of granularity, and generally loads faster than a comparable dynamic website. Popular static site generators include Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, and Astro.\nMy first choice was Jekyll but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find suitable documentation and it all seemed unwieldy. So, I decided to go with Hugo instead. Hugo is a static site generator written in the Go language. It is indisputably the fastest SSG on the market.\nHugo requires three dependencies: Git, Go, and Sass. I have been spoiled by Windows operating system and I had to get used to working in the terminal. With some Googling, grit, and a little help from Perplexity, I started to get the hang of it.\nI installed the dependencies and by following the instructions in the Quickstart tutorial, I got my first static website up and running. Configuring the website involves changing the default settings in the hugo.toml (or yaml) file and adding new values. I added a theme, wrote some pages, and started putting this post together.\nI have learnt to use git commits to track changes and “back up” my website. I have also brushed my rusty HTML wrangling skills a bit. I understand the Jamstack appeal now.\nThe website isn’t complete yet as at the time of wrting but I am very happy with where it is currently and look forward to bringing my vision to life.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more about Hugo and how it works, check out the official website .

However, the simple truth is, that if there is a loophole, people will try to exploit it.\nSource: Google\u0026rsquo;s SEO Starter Guide There have several SEO techniques over the years, ranging from straight keyword stuffing to image tags. However, the most prevalent by far has been publishing long-form content. SEOs figured out that the most reliable way to rank high on Google was to write the best article on the topic.\nIt became common to see 2000+ word articles trying to cover every possible search intent with semantic keywords and unnecessary FAQ lists. Recipe pages would include long stories to convince the search algorithm that their content was the most in-depth and relevant. And the worst part (or best, depending on who you ask) is that it worked!\nIt worked because Google was too busy trying to keep the audience’s attention on the increasingly visible ads on the SERPs to ensure that webmasters were writing content for people and not their algorithm.\nBefore the Helpful Content update, if you wrote a 3000-word article filled with semantic keywords and attention-grabbing images/videos, your article was guaranteed to rank. If your competitors caught up to you, you would add more words. Rinse and repeat.\nThe system ran on for a while. A good number of web content writers got paid by the word and were incentivized to write more words. Businesses got to rank on the first page of Google, so they had no reason to change what worked. SEO experts and service providers were able to create a bloated and overpriced industry. But web users were getting the short end of the stick with fluffy, uninteresting, and arduous-to-read content that had forgotten who it was meant to serve.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t explicitly blame SEOs for the turn of events. Behind the scenes, Google has been focused on solving one problem: maximizing profit potential from ad revenue. Google was too busy stealing answers with featured snippets (later AI Overviews) from creators to notice the growing attention issue they had contributed to.\nAs early as 2019, savvy users discovered that adding ‘site:reddit.com’ or simply ‘Reddit’ to their searches was the best way to skip the ads and 2500-word articles to get the actual answer they were looking for. Perhaps if they had the resources, Reddit Inc. could have created a worthwhile competitor to Google Search. Google would later add a ‘Discussions and forums’ section in late 2022 and would begin boosting Reddit and Quora in 2023.\nIn his popular piece \"The Man Who Killed Google Search\", Ed Zitron posits a name he believes was responsible for the current of search: Prabhakar Raghavan. However, I am inclined to disagree. Scapegoats are very easy to find and the real problem likely runs much deeper. Let\u0026rsquo;s see who is behind that mask\nAt the end of the day, Google itself ruined Google Search, and the company has no current incentive to fix it.\nSo, what can we do about it? We can start by using Google\u0026rsquo;s proprietary products less, writing helpful content for people and promoting it actively. You can go a step further and install a custom ROM (LineageOS and /e/OS are good options) on your Android device to shake things up a bit. Between us and the LLM chatbots, I\u0026rsquo;d wager that we could go some damage to the conglomerate.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/who-ruined-search/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eGoogle displaced other search engines by leveraging a simple, minimalistic interface and superior search algorithm.

Having a domain name and hosting grants you your own tiny cranny of the Internet that you can completely lord over. Unlike a social media account, you can’t be de-platformed and you don’t really have to deal with people you don’t like. Everyone, I believe, should have at least a blog on their website. It is a plus if the website is self-hosted (although mine isn\u0026rsquo;t).\nWordPress is the most popular option for people who want to build their own website and it is a great option. It is free, powerful, and quite customizable. However, it is overkill for most purposes. For my website, I decided to forego a traditional content management system like WordPress and opt for a static site generator instead.\nA static website is easier and cheaper to host, offers a lot of granularity, and generally loads faster than a comparable dynamic website. Popular static site generators include Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, and Astro.\nMy first choice was Jekyll but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find suitable documentation and it all seemed unwieldy. So, I decided to go with Hugo instead. Hugo is a static site generator written in the Go language. It is indisputably the fastest SSG on the market.\nHugo requires three dependencies: Git, Go, and Sass. I have been spoiled by Windows operating system and I had to get used to working in the terminal. With some Googling, grit, and a little help from Perplexity, I started to get the hang of it.\nI installed the dependencies and by following the instructions in the Quickstart tutorial, I got my first static website up and running. Configuring the website involves changing the default settings in the hugo.toml (or yaml) file and adding new values. I added a theme, wrote some pages, and started putting this post together.\nI have learnt to use git commits to track changes and “back up” my website. I have also brushed my rusty HTML wrangling skills a bit. I understand the Jamstack appeal now.\nThe website isn’t complete yet as at the time of wrting but I am very happy with where it is currently and look forward to bringing my vision to life.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more about Hugo and how it works, check out the official website .

It is part of a specific marketing campaign (social, email, or search) and encourages visitors to take a single, targeted action.\nIt is a proven fact that landing pages are better for conversions than websites. Even if your product’s value proposition is laid out perfectly on your homepage and it fits the ad campaign, you should still use a landing page. Why? Unlike your homepage, a landing page (ideally) has one jumping off point: the call-to-action.\nAn oft-touted statistic from Unbounce says that they checked 455 pages and found that, on average, a dedicated landing page has a 65 percent higher conversion rate than website pages. We have no further information about the study though.\nA detailed case study by Instapage concluded that a dedicated landing page had a conversion rate almost three times (~300%) of a homepage, despite having a lower click-through rate.\nA B2B landing page’s primary purpose is to convert visitors into leads or customers with a promise. Therefore, a dedicated landing page often means higher conversions.\nElements of a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page All landing pages do not convert equally. Just like your software product needs to meet certain requirements, a landing page needs certain elements to be effective:\nPromise: A good landing page must offer a specific promise. This promise must be clear to the audience and address the exact problem they want to solve. Source: Shopify For example, the above landing page by Shopify promises lower costs and business growth. It communicates its message with few words and an eye-catching design.\nThe best B2B SaaS landing pages also have a hero image/section that shows the product in action. The prospect should be able to see themselves using your product’s features and getting results. In practice, this might be a screenshot of the software interface, a picture/illustration of a satisfied user, or a video explaining the benefits of the product. Actual pictures of people using the product are often more powerful.\nSource: Hubstaff Pictures of people tend to be more emotionally appealing than illustrations and visualizations. Research has shown that relevant images of real people can lead to a 95% increase in conversion rates .\nProof: Proof is also vital for a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page. It shows the prospect that you can deliver on the promise. The landing page should have hard numbers and testimonials that communicate your brand’s value. You are leaving money on the table without social proof. Source: Strikingly It is hard to sell a prospect who doesn’t trust you. Your proof should be prominently placed on the landing page, second only to your call to action.\nPull: A strong pull complements the previous two elements. You need an interesting lead magnet and a well-placed call-to-action button. Not every B2B landing page needs a lead magnet, though. If you offer a free trial and/or don’t request for credit card information at sign up, that is the lead magnet.\nSource: Wix canonicalURL: https://tomisinolujinmi.com/posts/who-ruined-search Your lead capture form should be simple and conducive to a frictionless signup. In some cases (enterprise SaaS, especially), you should collect enough information to qualify the lead effectively. If you have a product that has a long sales cycle, asking for just an email address might attract low-quality leads.\nThe goal is to reduce friction without affecting lead quality. You can skip the email funnel entirely and go straight to the sign up and onboarding process.\nBest practices for designing a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page Having the above elements in your landing page doesn’t guarantee that your conversion rates will go through the roof. To make a great meal, it is not enough to have the right ingredients. You need to have them in the right proportion.\nHere is a list of what it takes to create a high-converting landing page for a B2B SaaS audience\n1. Navigation is a no-no Navigation blurs the line between a landing page and a regular website page. It dilutes attention and weakens the emphasis of your campaign. While some big names do it, it is not a recommended practice.\nSource: Quickbooks A landing page should ideally have one link on it – the call-to-action. This is why you should never send traffic to your homepage and why having a dedicated landing page for each campaign cannot be overemphasized.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude a top navigation bar on the landing page Include a YouTube video (distracting and provides a click-away point) Have more than one call-to-action Do:\nHave a single call-to-action Use Wistia for demo videos, if needed Provide all relevant information on the landing page itself 2. Responsiveness and speed are not negotiable Source: Carrd A good landing page loads fast and looks good on all devices. In 2024, Unbounce carried out a study of over 40000 landing pages and found out that 79% of SaaS landing page visits came from mobile devices.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness. If your website runs on WordPress, use a lightweight theme like Astra or GeneratePress and avoid page builders.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness. If your website runs on WordPress, use a lightweight theme like Astra or GeneratePress and avoid page builders.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude everything that has your brand or product’s name on it. Use large images Avoid WordPress page builders like Divi and Elementor (or use a caching plugin) Do:\nUse compressed images, preferably Webp Use a block editor for WordPress Test your page\u0026rsquo;s loading speed with PageSpeed Insights before publishing. 3. Clean, relevant copy complements great design Source: Mailchimp Good copy won\u0026rsquo;t save bad design. The landing page’s design is the first thing the prospect sees. If the design looks good and tenable, then they stick around to read the copy.\nThe copy should talk about your brand, not the competition. A landing page is not where you talk in detail about how your product is much better than the competition. A good B2B landing page should focus on two parties: you and your target customer.\nSource: Zoho Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re at a high-end restaurant and instead of giving you the menu and letting you choose what you\u0026rsquo;d like to eat, the waiter starts talking about how this restaurant is much better than the one down the street. You\u0026rsquo;d probably encourage him to give you the menu and let you come to your own conclusion. It\u0026rsquo;s the same thing with selling B2B SaaS products.\nMost prospects don\u0026rsquo;t care about who you\u0026rsquo;re better than; they just want to get the best value.\nWhile there are no studies on the performance of AI-generated vs human-written copy, a landing page is no place, in my opinion, for the generic content LLMs are known for. AI-assisted copy is generally fine, as long as it feels personal and retains your tone of voice.\n4. A/B testing Always Be Testing. A/B testing, also known as split testing, tests two different versions of a page to see which performs best. With A/B testing, you can tweak different elements on your B2B SaaS landing page (headlines, product images, calls-to-action, etc) and see what makes a difference in overall conversions.\nHowever, be cautious of being hyper-focused on minor details at the expense of the big picture. The majority of copy and design choices will be driven by gut feeling, personal taste, and experience.\nA/B tests should be concentrated on the parts of the landing page that directly influence conversions: copy length, headlines, form fields, call-to-action and key visuals.\nThere are no set rules for A/B testing though. Yourhttps://www.q personal experience and campaign goals should inform the tests you perform.\n5.

SEOs figured out that the most reliable way to rank high on Google was to write the best article on the topic.\nIt became common to see 2000+ word articles trying to cover every possible search intent with semantic keywords and unnecessary FAQ lists. Recipe pages would include long stories to convince the search algorithm that their content was the most in-depth and relevant. And the worst part (or best, depending on who you ask) is that it worked!\nIt worked because Google was too busy trying to keep the audience’s attention on the increasingly visible ads on the SERPs to ensure that webmasters were writing content for people and not their algorithm.\nBefore the Helpful Content update, if you wrote a 3000-word article filled with semantic keywords and attention-grabbing images/videos, your article was guaranteed to rank. If your competitors caught up to you, you would add more words. Rinse and repeat.\nThe system ran on for a while. A good number of web content writers got paid by the word and were incentivized to write more words. Businesses got to rank on the first page of Google, so they had no reason to change what worked. SEO experts and service providers were able to create a bloated and overpriced industry. But web users were getting the short end of the stick with fluffy, uninteresting, and arduous-to-read content that had forgotten who it was meant to serve.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t explicitly blame SEOs for the turn of events. Behind the scenes, Google has been focused on solving one problem: maximizing profit potential from ad revenue. Google was too busy stealing answers with featured snippets (later AI Overviews) from creators to notice the growing attention issue they had contributed to.\nAs early as 2019, savvy users discovered that adding ‘site:reddit.com’ or simply ‘Reddit’ to their searches was the best way to skip the ads and 2500-word articles to get the actual answer they were looking for. Perhaps if they had the resources, Reddit Inc. could have created a worthwhile competitor to Google Search. Google would later add a ‘Discussions and forums’ section in late 2022 and would begin boosting Reddit and Quora in 2023.\nIn his popular piece \"The Man Who Killed Google Search\", Ed Zitron posits a name he believes was responsible for the current of search: Prabhakar Raghavan. However, I am inclined to disagree. Scapegoats are very easy to find and the real problem likely runs much deeper. Let\u0026rsquo;s see who is behind that mask\nAt the end of the day, Google itself ruined Google Search, and the company has no current incentive to fix it.\nSo, what can we do about it? We can start by using Google\u0026rsquo;s proprietary products less, writing helpful content for people and promoting it actively. You can go a step further and install a custom ROM (LineageOS and /e/OS are good options) on your Android device to shake things up a bit.

It is part of a specific marketing campaign (social, email, or search) and encourages visitors to take a single, targeted action.\nIt is a proven fact that landing pages are better for conversions than websites. Even if your product’s value proposition is laid out perfectly on your homepage and it fits the ad campaign, you should still use a landing page. Why? Unlike your homepage, a landing page (ideally) has one jumping off point: the call-to-action.\nAn oft-touted statistic from Unbounce says that they checked 455 pages and found that, on average, a dedicated landing page has a 65 percent higher conversion rate than website pages. We have no further information about the study though.\nA detailed case study by Instapage concluded that a dedicated landing page had a conversion rate almost three times (~300%) of a homepage, despite having a lower click-through rate.\nA B2B landing page’s primary purpose is to convert visitors into leads or customers with a promise. Therefore, a dedicated landing page often means higher conversions.\nElements of a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page All landing pages do not convert equally. Just like your software product needs to meet certain requirements, a landing page needs certain elements to be effective:\nPromise: A good landing page must offer a specific promise. This promise must be clear to the audience and address the exact problem they want to solve. Source: Shopify For example, the above landing page by Shopify promises lower costs and business growth. It communicates its message with few words and an eye-catching design.\nThe best B2B SaaS landing pages also have a hero image/section that shows the product in action. The prospect should be able to see themselves using your product’s features and getting results. In practice, this might be a screenshot of the software interface, a picture/illustration of a satisfied user, or a video explaining the benefits of the product. Actual pictures of people using the product are often more powerful.\nSource: Hubstaff Pictures of people tend to be more emotionally appealing than illustrations and visualizations. Research has shown that relevant images of real people can lead to a 95% increase in conversion rates .\nProof: Proof is also vital for a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page. It shows the prospect that you can deliver on the promise. The landing page should have hard numbers and testimonials that communicate your brand’s value. You are leaving money on the table without social proof. Source: Strikingly It is hard to sell a prospect who doesn’t trust you. Your proof should be prominently placed on the landing page, second only to your call to action.\nPull: A strong pull complements the previous two elements. You need an interesting lead magnet and a well-placed call-to-action button. Not every B2B landing page needs a lead magnet, though. If you offer a free trial and/or don’t request for credit card information at sign up, that is the lead magnet.\nSource: Wix canonicalURL: https://tomisinolujinmi.com/posts/who-ruined-search Your lead capture form should be simple and conducive to a frictionless signup. In some cases (enterprise SaaS, especially), you should collect enough information to qualify the lead effectively. If you have a product that has a long sales cycle, asking for just an email address might attract low-quality leads.\nThe goal is to reduce friction without affecting lead quality. You can skip the email funnel entirely and go straight to the sign up and onboarding process.\nBest practices for designing a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page Having the above elements in your landing page doesn’t guarantee that your conversion rates will go through the roof. To make a great meal, it is not enough to have the right ingredients. You need to have them in the right proportion.\nHere is a list of what it takes to create a high-converting landing page for a B2B SaaS audience\n1. Navigation is a no-no Navigation blurs the line between a landing page and a regular website page. It dilutes attention and weakens the emphasis of your campaign. While some big names do it, it is not a recommended practice.\nSource: Quickbooks A landing page should ideally have one link on it – the call-to-action. This is why you should never send traffic to your homepage and why having a dedicated landing page for each campaign cannot be overemphasized.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude a top navigation bar on the landing page Include a YouTube video (distracting and provides a click-away point) Have more than one call-to-action Do:\nHave a single call-to-action Use Wistia for demo videos, if needed Provide all relevant information on the landing page itself 2. Responsiveness and speed are not negotiable Source: Carrd A good landing page loads fast and looks good on all devices. In 2024, Unbounce carried out a study of over 40000 landing pages and found out that 79% of SaaS landing page visits came from mobile devices.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness. If your website runs on WordPress, use a lightweight theme like Astra or GeneratePress and avoid page builders.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness. If your website runs on WordPress, use a lightweight theme like Astra or GeneratePress and avoid page builders.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude everything that has your brand or product’s name on it. Use large images Avoid WordPress page builders like Divi and Elementor (or use a caching plugin) Do:\nUse compressed images, preferably Webp Use a block editor for WordPress Test your page\u0026rsquo;s loading speed with PageSpeed Insights before publishing. 3. Clean, relevant copy complements great design Source: Mailchimp Good copy won\u0026rsquo;t save bad design. The landing page’s design is the first thing the prospect sees. If the design looks good and tenable, then they stick around to read the copy.\nThe copy should talk about your brand, not the competition. A landing page is not where you talk in detail about how your product is much better than the competition. A good B2B landing page should focus on two parties: you and your target customer.\nSource: Zoho Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re at a high-end restaurant and instead of giving you the menu and letting you choose what you\u0026rsquo;d like to eat, the waiter starts talking about how this restaurant is much better than the one down the street. You\u0026rsquo;d probably encourage him to give you the menu and let you come to your own conclusion. It\u0026rsquo;s the same thing with selling B2B SaaS products.\nMost prospects don\u0026rsquo;t care about who you\u0026rsquo;re better than; they just want to get the best value.\nWhile there are no studies on the performance of AI-generated vs human-written copy, a landing page is no place, in my opinion, for the generic content LLMs are known for. AI-assisted copy is generally fine, as long as it feels personal and retains your tone of voice.\n4. A/B testing Always Be Testing. A/B testing, also known as split testing, tests two different versions of a page to see which performs best. With A/B testing, you can tweak different elements on your B2B SaaS landing page (headlines, product images, calls-to-action, etc) and see what makes a difference in overall conversions.\nHowever, be cautious of being hyper-focused on minor details at the expense of the big picture. The majority of copy and design choices will be driven by gut feeling, personal taste, and experience.\nA/B tests should be concentrated on the parts of the landing page that directly influence conversions: copy length, headlines, form fields, call-to-action and key visuals.\nThere are no set rules for A/B testing though. Yourhttps://www.q personal experience and campaign goals should inform the tests you perform.\n5. Keep it simple Source: Brett White/Medium Unbounce’s 2024 Conversion Benchmark Report puts the conversion rate for SaaS landing pages at 3.8%, 42% lower than the industry average of 6.6%. SaaS landing pages are more likely to use complex copy than other industries, leaving prospects confused about the value proposition.\nCopy that is simple and easy to understand converts five times better.\nForget the industry jargon and verbose descriptions. If your product has advanced features that are difficult to explain, opt for a demo video and keep the copy stupid simple.\nIf you found this guide useful, feel free to share it!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/b2b-saas-landing-page/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA B2B SaaS landing page is a focused, standalone web page designed to convert business (B2B) prospects into leads or customers for a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product.

They have taken over from featured snippets as Google’s latest attempt at keeping users on the SERP with zero-click searches.\nAI Overviews have become much better than when they first launched but I still think they are net negative on the search experience and are better off hidden away in a collapsible drop-down menu like People Also Ask.\nThat pretty much sums up my thoughts on AI Overviews. But, do read on if you want to know why I have a gripe with AI overviews:\n1. They are not better than featured snippets AI Overviews feel like a poorly thought-out solution to a problem that doesn’t exist. It is a perfect example of a solution looking for a problem.\nSource: Ben Collins (X) Google already displayed featured snippets prominently at the top of SERPs and while webmasters complained for a while, it was generally seen as the cost of doing business with a profit-driven conglomerate. Google has now replaced the passable featured snippets with slower and far less accurate AI Overviews. It is a downgrade on several levels. I never thought I would miss featured snippets but here we are.\nGoogle Search has become a sorry state of affairs with AI-generated summaries of AI-generated content.\n2. The overviews are scraped content The root of the problem is Google’s decision to compete with publishers for clicks and traffic, similar to most social media platforms.\nGoogle went from being a search engine that allowed people to find interesting websites and articles to scraping the content and publishing it on their SERPs directly. Some people would argue web crawling and web scraping are completely different but I’d argue that there is only a fine distinction.\nGoogle didn’t become a web scraping service until it introduced schema markups which enhanced user experience but blurred the line between the publisher and the medium. They followed up with weather updates and live sports scores before going all in with featured snippets.\nGoogle has been scraping content and stealing traffic from publishers for a while. It is different now because AI Overviews only benefit the company and not the users.\nSoon, Google might stop showing websites entirely and simply display complete articles scraped from different sources .\n3. They are on by default I would be far less bothered with AI Overviews if Google made it easy to turn them off completely.\nThere is the Web (or “udm-14) workaround popularized by Ernie Smith of Tedium, but there is no official setting from Google that allows you to hide AI Overviews from searches across all devices.\nThe official reason is that Google knows what you want better than you do .\nAI Overviews always felt like a feature that Google was pressured to include. For the first time in the history of search, another search engine beat Google to the punch leveraging AI – technology that was a core part of Google’s business. The top guns panicked and had the teams push out a feature that was not close to being ready.\nIt is not exactly groundbreaking technology but it is enough to keep the movers and shakers happy. Turning it off would imply that Google was wrong to include in the first place and egos tend to fly sky high when you are as large as Google.\nTen blue links, how I\u0026rsquo;ve missed you\nThe “Web” results view is unburdened with AI results, for now. You can get a clean list of results by selecting Web from the menu at the bottom of the search bar or by adding “\u0026amp;udm-14” to the search URL. Ernie’s original blog post shows you how to set it up in your browser. TenBlueLinks and Ernie’s udm14 website can also be used as custom search engines. Enjoy it while it lasts.\nTip: You can add -ai to your search query for a quick fix\nSince the fiasco with the rocks and glue eating, Google has been more cautious with displaying AI Overviews. I’ve noticed AI Overviews appear more in informational searches and are less present in searches related to medicine (soon to be changed , finance, and politics.

Even if your product’s value proposition is laid out perfectly on your homepage and it fits the ad campaign, you should still use a landing page. Why? Unlike your homepage, a landing page (ideally) has one jumping off point: the call-to-action.\nAn oft-touted statistic from Unbounce says that they checked 455 pages and found that, on average, a dedicated landing page has a 65 percent higher conversion rate than website pages. We have no further information about the study though.\nA detailed case study by Instapage concluded that a dedicated landing page had a conversion rate almost three times (~300%) of a homepage, despite having a lower click-through rate.\nA B2B landing page’s primary purpose is to convert visitors into leads or customers with a promise. Therefore, a dedicated landing page often means higher conversions.\nElements of a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page All landing pages do not convert equally. Just like your software product needs to meet certain requirements, a landing page needs certain elements to be effective:\nPromise: A good landing page must offer a specific promise. This promise must be clear to the audience and address the exact problem they want to solve. Source: Shopify For example, the above landing page by Shopify promises lower costs and business growth. It communicates its message with few words and an eye-catching design.\nThe best B2B SaaS landing pages also have a hero image/section that shows the product in action. The prospect should be able to see themselves using your product’s features and getting results. In practice, this might be a screenshot of the software interface, a picture/illustration of a satisfied user, or a video explaining the benefits of the product. Actual pictures of people using the product are often more powerful.\nSource: Hubstaff Pictures of people tend to be more emotionally appealing than illustrations and visualizations. Research has shown that relevant images of real people can lead to a 95% increase in conversion rates .\nProof: Proof is also vital for a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page. It shows the prospect that you can deliver on the promise. The landing page should have hard numbers and testimonials that communicate your brand’s value. You are leaving money on the table without social proof. Source: Strikingly It is hard to sell a prospect who doesn’t trust you. Your proof should be prominently placed on the landing page, second only to your call to action.\nPull: A strong pull complements the previous two elements. You need an interesting lead magnet and a well-placed call-to-action button. Not every B2B landing page needs a lead magnet, though. If you offer a free trial and/or don’t request for credit card information at sign up, that is the lead magnet.\nSource: Wix canonicalURL: https://tomisinolujinmi.com/posts/who-ruined-search Your lead capture form should be simple and conducive to a frictionless signup. In some cases (enterprise SaaS, especially), you should collect enough information to qualify the lead effectively. If you have a product that has a long sales cycle, asking for just an email address might attract low-quality leads.\nThe goal is to reduce friction without affecting lead quality. You can skip the email funnel entirely and go straight to the sign up and onboarding process.\nBest practices for designing a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page Having the above elements in your landing page doesn’t guarantee that your conversion rates will go through the roof. To make a great meal, it is not enough to have the right ingredients. You need to have them in the right proportion.\nHere is a list of what it takes to create a high-converting landing page for a B2B SaaS audience\n1. Navigation is a no-no Navigation blurs the line between a landing page and a regular website page. It dilutes attention and weakens the emphasis of your campaign. While some big names do it, it is not a recommended practice.\nSource: Quickbooks A landing page should ideally have one link on it – the call-to-action. This is why you should never send traffic to your homepage and why having a dedicated landing page for each campaign cannot be overemphasized.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude a top navigation bar on the landing page Include a YouTube video (distracting and provides a click-away point) Have more than one call-to-action Do:\nHave a single call-to-action Use Wistia for demo videos, if needed Provide all relevant information on the landing page itself 2. Responsiveness and speed are not negotiable Source: Carrd A good landing page loads fast and looks good on all devices. In 2024, Unbounce carried out a study of over 40000 landing pages and found out that 79% of SaaS landing page visits came from mobile devices.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness.

Clean, relevant copy complements great design Source: Mailchimp Good copy won\u0026rsquo;t save bad design. The landing page’s design is the first thing the prospect sees. If the design looks good and tenable, then they stick around to read the copy.\nThe copy should talk about your brand, not the competition. A landing page is not where you talk in detail about how your product is much better than the competition. A good B2B landing page should focus on two parties: you and your target customer.\nSource: Zoho Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re at a high-end restaurant and instead of giving you the menu and letting you choose what you\u0026rsquo;d like to eat, the waiter starts talking about how this restaurant is much better than the one down the street. You\u0026rsquo;d probably encourage him to give you the menu and let you come to your own conclusion. It\u0026rsquo;s the same thing with selling B2B SaaS products.\nMost prospects don\u0026rsquo;t care about who you\u0026rsquo;re better than; they just want to get the best value.\nWhile there are no studies on the performance of AI-generated vs human-written copy, a landing page is no place, in my opinion, for the generic content LLMs are known for. AI-assisted copy is generally fine, as long as it feels personal and retains your tone of voice.\n4. A/B testing Always Be Testing. A/B testing, also known as split testing, tests two different versions of a page to see which performs best. With A/B testing, you can tweak different elements on your B2B SaaS landing page (headlines, product images, calls-to-action, etc) and see what makes a difference in overall conversions.\nHowever, be cautious of being hyper-focused on minor details at the expense of the big picture. The majority of copy and design choices will be driven by gut feeling, personal taste, and experience.\nA/B tests should be concentrated on the parts of the landing page that directly influence conversions: copy length, headlines, form fields, call-to-action and key visuals.\nThere are no set rules for A/B testing though. Yourhttps://www.q personal experience and campaign goals should inform the tests you perform.\n5. Keep it simple Source: Brett White/Medium Unbounce’s 2024 Conversion Benchmark Report puts the conversion rate for SaaS landing pages at 3.8%, 42% lower than the industry average of 6.6%. SaaS landing pages are more likely to use complex copy than other industries, leaving prospects confused about the value proposition.\nCopy that is simple and easy to understand converts five times better.\nForget the industry jargon and verbose descriptions. If your product has advanced features that are difficult to explain, opt for a demo video and keep the copy stupid simple.\nIf you found this guide useful, feel free to share it!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/b2b-saas-landing-page/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA B2B SaaS landing page is a focused, standalone web page designed to convert business (B2B) prospects into leads or customers for a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product.

They have taken over from featured snippets as Google’s latest attempt at keeping users on the SERP with zero-click searches.\nAI Overviews have become much better than when they first launched but I still think they are net negative on the search experience and are better off hidden away in a collapsible drop-down menu like People Also Ask.\nThat pretty much sums up my thoughts on AI Overviews. But, do read on if you want to know why I have a gripe with AI overviews:\n1. They are not better than featured snippets AI Overviews feel like a poorly thought-out solution to a problem that doesn’t exist. It is a perfect example of a solution looking for a problem.\nSource: Ben Collins (X) Google already displayed featured snippets prominently at the top of SERPs and while webmasters complained for a while, it was generally seen as the cost of doing business with a profit-driven conglomerate. Google has now replaced the passable featured snippets with slower and far less accurate AI Overviews. It is a downgrade on several levels. I never thought I would miss featured snippets but here we are.\nGoogle Search has become a sorry state of affairs with AI-generated summaries of AI-generated content.\n2. The overviews are scraped content The root of the problem is Google’s decision to compete with publishers for clicks and traffic, similar to most social media platforms.\nGoogle went from being a search engine that allowed people to find interesting websites and articles to scraping the content and publishing it on their SERPs directly. Some people would argue web crawling and web scraping are completely different but I’d argue that there is only a fine distinction.\nGoogle didn’t become a web scraping service until it introduced schema markups which enhanced user experience but blurred the line between the publisher and the medium. They followed up with weather updates and live sports scores before going all in with featured snippets.\nGoogle has been scraping content and stealing traffic from publishers for a while. It is different now because AI Overviews only benefit the company and not the users.\nSoon, Google might stop showing websites entirely and simply display complete articles scraped from different sources .\n3. They are on by default I would be far less bothered with AI Overviews if Google made it easy to turn them off completely.\nThere is the Web (or “udm-14) workaround popularized by Ernie Smith of Tedium, but there is no official setting from Google that allows you to hide AI Overviews from searches across all devices.\nThe official reason is that Google knows what you want better than you do .\nAI Overviews always felt like a feature that Google was pressured to include. For the first time in the history of search, another search engine beat Google to the punch leveraging AI – technology that was a core part of Google’s business. The top guns panicked and had the teams push out a feature that was not close to being ready.\nIt is not exactly groundbreaking technology but it is enough to keep the movers and shakers happy. Turning it off would imply that Google was wrong to include in the first place and egos tend to fly sky high when you are as large as Google.\nTen blue links, how I\u0026rsquo;ve missed you\nThe “Web” results view is unburdened with AI results, for now. You can get a clean list of results by selecting Web from the menu at the bottom of the search bar or by adding “\u0026amp;udm-14” to the search URL. Ernie’s original blog post shows you how to set it up in your browser. TenBlueLinks and Ernie’s udm14 website can also be used as custom search engines. Enjoy it while it lasts.\nTip: You can add -ai to your search query for a quick fix\nSince the fiasco with the rocks and glue eating, Google has been more cautious with displaying AI Overviews. I’ve noticed AI Overviews appear more in informational searches and are less present in searches related to medicine (soon to be changed , finance, and politics. Due to how LLMs work, overviews also do not appear for breaking news or trending content.

While its competitors were cluttered, ad-ridden web portals, Google had one specific purpose, and it did it well.\nThis was what Google looked like then:\nSource: Google Search Blog Today, Google’s search engine is partly an AI chatbot and partly a portal to Reddit. Ads are displayed prominently above the fold. The top search results are fluffy, long-form content ranking primarily because of the number of keywords and backlinks on the page. Despite the company\u0026rsquo;s best efforts to convince us otherwise, Google cannot reliably infer content quality. Therefore, the algorithm has to make do with other less important and more easily faked signals.\nSince businesses started getting on the Web, it has been a dance between Google and SEOs with each end trying to get the better of the other. Google would release a new algorithm update and SEO experts would try to reverse-engineer it based on their observations and opinions.\nThese observations would become tactics and strategies, and if you had a website that relied on getting traffic from Google, you had to pay attention. Occasionally, Google would release a guide with some helpful tips and some intentionally vague advice like “Make your site interesting and useful.” The company encouraged search engine optimization, as long as you didn\u0026rsquo;t game the system. However, the simple truth is, that if there is a loophole, people will try to exploit it.\nSource: Google\u0026rsquo;s SEO Starter Guide There have several SEO techniques over the years, ranging from straight keyword stuffing to image tags. However, the most prevalent by far has been publishing long-form content. SEOs figured out that the most reliable way to rank high on Google was to write the best article on the topic.\nIt became common to see 2000+ word articles trying to cover every possible search intent with semantic keywords and unnecessary FAQ lists. Recipe pages would include long stories to convince the search algorithm that their content was the most in-depth and relevant. And the worst part (or best, depending on who you ask) is that it worked!\nIt worked because Google was too busy trying to keep the audience’s attention on the increasingly visible ads on the SERPs to ensure that webmasters were writing content for people and not their algorithm.\nBefore the Helpful Content update, if you wrote a 3000-word article filled with semantic keywords and attention-grabbing images/videos, your article was guaranteed to rank. If your competitors caught up to you, you would add more words. Rinse and repeat.\nThe system ran on for a while. A good number of web content writers got paid by the word and were incentivized to write more words. Businesses got to rank on the first page of Google, so they had no reason to change what worked. SEO experts and service providers were able to create a bloated and overpriced industry. But web users were getting the short end of the stick with fluffy, uninteresting, and arduous-to-read content that had forgotten who it was meant to serve.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t explicitly blame SEOs for the turn of events. Behind the scenes, Google has been focused on solving one problem: maximizing profit potential from ad revenue. Google was too busy stealing answers with featured snippets (later AI Overviews) from creators to notice the growing attention issue they had contributed to.\nAs early as 2019, savvy users discovered that adding ‘site:reddit.com’ or simply ‘Reddit’ to their searches was the best way to skip the ads and 2500-word articles to get the actual answer they were looking for. Perhaps if they had the resources, Reddit Inc. could have created a worthwhile competitor to Google Search. Google would later add a ‘Discussions and forums’ section in late 2022 and would begin boosting Reddit and Quora in 2023.\nIn his popular piece \"The Man Who Killed Google Search\", Ed Zitron posits a name he believes was responsible for the current of search: Prabhakar Raghavan. However, I am inclined to disagree. Scapegoats are very easy to find and the real problem likely runs much deeper. Let\u0026rsquo;s see who is behind that mask\nAt the end of the day, Google itself ruined Google Search, and the company has no current incentive to fix it.\nSo, what can we do about it? We can start by using Google\u0026rsquo;s proprietary products less, writing helpful content for people and promoting it actively. You can go a step further and install a custom ROM (LineageOS and /e/OS are good options) on your Android device to shake things up a bit. Between us and the LLM chatbots, I\u0026rsquo;d wager that we could go some damage to the conglomerate.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/who-ruined-search/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eGoogle displaced other search engines by leveraging a simple, minimalistic interface and superior search algorithm.

Having a domain name and hosting grants you your own tiny cranny of the Internet that you can completely lord over. Unlike a social media account, you can’t be de-platformed and you don’t really have to deal with people you don’t like. Everyone, I believe, should have at least a blog on their website. It is a plus if the website is self-hosted (although mine isn\u0026rsquo;t).\nWordPress is the most popular option for people who want to build their own website and it is a great option. It is free, powerful, and quite customizable. However, it is overkill for most purposes. For my website, I decided to forego a traditional content management system like WordPress and opt for a static site generator instead.\nA static website is easier and cheaper to host, offers a lot of granularity, and generally loads faster than a comparable dynamic website. Popular static site generators include Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, and Astro.\nMy first choice was Jekyll but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find suitable documentation and it all seemed unwieldy. So, I decided to go with Hugo instead. Hugo is a static site generator written in the Go language. It is indisputably the fastest SSG on the market.\nHugo requires three dependencies: Git, Go, and Sass. I have been spoiled by Windows operating system and I had to get used to working in the terminal. With some Googling, grit, and a little help from Perplexity, I started to get the hang of it.\nI installed the dependencies and by following the instructions in the Quickstart tutorial, I got my first static website up and running. Configuring the website involves changing the default settings in the hugo.toml (or yaml) file and adding new values. I added a theme, wrote some pages, and started putting this post together.\nI have learnt to use git commits to track changes and “back up” my website. I have also brushed my rusty HTML wrangling skills a bit. I understand the Jamstack appeal now.\nThe website isn’t complete yet as at the time of wrting but I am very happy with where it is currently and look forward to bringing my vision to life.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more about Hugo and how it works, check out the official website .

While its competitors were cluttered, ad-ridden web portals, Google had one specific purpose, and it did it well.\nThis was what Google looked like then:\nSource: Google Search Blog Today, Google’s search engine is partly an AI chatbot and partly a portal to Reddit. Ads are displayed prominently above the fold. The top search results are fluffy, long-form content ranking primarily because of the number of keywords and backlinks on the page. Despite the company\u0026rsquo;s best efforts to convince us otherwise, Google cannot reliably infer content quality. Therefore, the algorithm has to make do with other less important and more easily faked signals.\nSince businesses started getting on the Web, it has been a dance between Google and SEOs with each end trying to get the better of the other. Google would release a new algorithm update and SEO experts would try to reverse-engineer it based on their observations and opinions.\nThese observations would become tactics and strategies, and if you had a website that relied on getting traffic from Google, you had to pay attention. Occasionally, Google would release a guide with some helpful tips and some intentionally vague advice like “Make your site interesting and useful.” The company encouraged search engine optimization, as long as you didn\u0026rsquo;t game the system. However, the simple truth is, that if there is a loophole, people will try to exploit it.\nSource: Google\u0026rsquo;s SEO Starter Guide There have several SEO techniques over the years, ranging from straight keyword stuffing to image tags. However, the most prevalent by far has been publishing long-form content. SEOs figured out that the most reliable way to rank high on Google was to write the best article on the topic.\nIt became common to see 2000+ word articles trying to cover every possible search intent with semantic keywords and unnecessary FAQ lists. Recipe pages would include long stories to convince the search algorithm that their content was the most in-depth and relevant. And the worst part (or best, depending on who you ask) is that it worked!\nIt worked because Google was too busy trying to keep the audience’s attention on the increasingly visible ads on the SERPs to ensure that webmasters were writing content for people and not their algorithm.\nBefore the Helpful Content update, if you wrote a 3000-word article filled with semantic keywords and attention-grabbing images/videos, your article was guaranteed to rank. If your competitors caught up to you, you would add more words. Rinse and repeat.\nThe system ran on for a while. A good number of web content writers got paid by the word and were incentivized to write more words. Businesses got to rank on the first page of Google, so they had no reason to change what worked. SEO experts and service providers were able to create a bloated and overpriced industry. But web users were getting the short end of the stick with fluffy, uninteresting, and arduous-to-read content that had forgotten who it was meant to serve.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t explicitly blame SEOs for the turn of events. Behind the scenes, Google has been focused on solving one problem: maximizing profit potential from ad revenue. Google was too busy stealing answers with featured snippets (later AI Overviews) from creators to notice the growing attention issue they had contributed to.\nAs early as 2019, savvy users discovered that adding ‘site:reddit.com’ or simply ‘Reddit’ to their searches was the best way to skip the ads and 2500-word articles to get the actual answer they were looking for. Perhaps if they had the resources, Reddit Inc. could have created a worthwhile competitor to Google Search. Google would later add a ‘Discussions and forums’ section in late 2022 and would begin boosting Reddit and Quora in 2023.\nIn his popular piece \"The Man Who Killed Google Search\", Ed Zitron posits a name he believes was responsible for the current of search: Prabhakar Raghavan. However, I am inclined to disagree. Scapegoats are very easy to find and the real problem likely runs much deeper. Let\u0026rsquo;s see who is behind that mask\nAt the end of the day, Google itself ruined Google Search, and the company has no current incentive to fix it.\nSo, what can we do about it? We can start by using Google\u0026rsquo;s proprietary products less, writing helpful content for people and promoting it actively. You can go a step further and install a custom ROM (LineageOS and /e/OS are good options) on your Android device to shake things up a bit. Between us and the LLM chatbots, I\u0026rsquo;d wager that we could go some damage to the conglomerate.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/who-ruined-search/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eGoogle displaced other search engines by leveraging a simple, minimalistic interface and superior search algorithm.

Having a domain name and hosting grants you your own tiny cranny of the Internet that you can completely lord over. Unlike a social media account, you can’t be de-platformed and you don’t really have to deal with people you don’t like. Everyone, I believe, should have at least a blog on their website. It is a plus if the website is self-hosted (although mine isn\u0026rsquo;t).\nWordPress is the most popular option for people who want to build their own website and it is a great option. It is free, powerful, and quite customizable. However, it is overkill for most purposes. For my website, I decided to forego a traditional content management system like WordPress and opt for a static site generator instead.\nA static website is easier and cheaper to host, offers a lot of granularity, and generally loads faster than a comparable dynamic website. Popular static site generators include Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, and Astro.\nMy first choice was Jekyll but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find suitable documentation and it all seemed unwieldy. So, I decided to go with Hugo instead. Hugo is a static site generator written in the Go language. It is indisputably the fastest SSG on the market.\nHugo requires three dependencies: Git, Go, and Sass. I have been spoiled by Windows operating system and I had to get used to working in the terminal. With some Googling, grit, and a little help from Perplexity, I started to get the hang of it.\nI installed the dependencies and by following the instructions in the Quickstart tutorial, I got my first static website up and running. Configuring the website involves changing the default settings in the hugo.toml (or yaml) file and adding new values. I added a theme, wrote some pages, and started putting this post together.\nI have learnt to use git commits to track changes and “back up” my website. I have also brushed my rusty HTML wrangling skills a bit. I understand the Jamstack appeal now.\nThe website isn’t complete yet as at the time of wrting but I am very happy with where it is currently and look forward to bringing my vision to life.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more about Hugo and how it works, check out the official website .

It is part of a specific marketing campaign (social, email, or search) and encourages visitors to take a single, targeted action.\nIt is a proven fact that landing pages are better for conversions than websites. Even if your product’s value proposition is laid out perfectly on your homepage and it fits the ad campaign, you should still use a landing page. Why? Unlike your homepage, a landing page (ideally) has one jumping off point: the call-to-action.\nAn oft-touted statistic from \u0026ldquo;Unbounce \u0026rdquo; says that they checked 455 pages and found that, on average, a dedicated landing page has a 65 percent higher conversion rate than website pages. We have no further information about the study though.\nA detailed case study by Instapage concluded that a dedicated landing page had a conversion rate almost three times (~300%) of a homepage, despite having a lower click-through rate.\nA B2B landing page’s primary purpose is to convert visitors into leads or customers with a promise. Therefore, a dedicated landing page often means higher conversions.\nElements of a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page All landing pages do not convert equally. Just like your software product needs to meet certain requirements, a landing page needs certain elements to be effective:\nPromise: A good landing page must offer a specific promise. This promise must be clear to the audience and address the exact problem they want to solve. Source: Shopify For example, the above landing page by Shopify promises lower costs and business growth. It communicates its message with few words and an eye-catching design.\nThe best B2B SaaS landing pages also have a hero image/section that shows the product in action. The prospect should be able to see themselves using your product’s features and getting results. In practice, this might be a screenshot of the software interface, a picture/illustration of a satisfied user, or a video explaining the benefits of the product. Actual pictures of people using the product are often more powerful.\nSource: Hubstaff Pictures of people tend to be more emotionally appealing than illustrations and visualizations. Research has shown that relevant images of real people can lead to a 95% increase in conversion rates .\nProof: Proof is also vital for a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page. It shows the prospect that you can deliver on the promise. The landing page should have hard numbers and testimonials that communicate your brand’s value. You are leaving money on the table without social proof. Source: Strikingly It is hard to sell a prospect who doesn’t trust you. Your proof should be prominently placed on the landing page, second only to your call to action.\nPull: A strong pull complements the previous two elements. You need an interesting lead magnet and a well-placed call-to-action button. Not every B2B landing page needs a lead magnet, though. If you offer a free trial and/or don’t request for credit card information at sign up, that is the lead magnet.\nSource: Wix canonicalURL: https://tomisinolujinmi.com/posts/who-ruined-search Your lead capture form should be simple and conducive to a frictionless signup. In some cases (enterprise SaaS, especially), you should collect enough information to qualify the lead effectively. If you have a product that has a long sales cycle, asking for just an email address might attract low-quality leads.\nThe goal is to reduce friction without affecting lead quality. You can skip the email funnel entirely and go straight to the sign up and onboarding process.\nBest practices for designing a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page Having the above elements in your landing page doesn’t guarantee that your conversion rates will go through the roof. To make a great meal, it is not enough to have the right ingredients. You need to have them in the right proportion.\nHere is a list of what it takes to create a high-converting landing page for a B2B SaaS audience\n1. Navigation is a no-no Navigation blurs the line between a landing page and a regular website page. It dilutes attention and weakens the emphasis of your campaign. While some big names do it, it is not a recommended practice.\nSource: Quickbooks A landing page should ideally have one link on it – the call-to-action. This is why you should never send traffic to your homepage and why having a dedicated landing page for each campaign cannot be overemphasized.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude a top navigation bar on the landing page Include a YouTube video (distracting and provides a click-away point) Have more than one call-to-action Do:\nHave a single call-to-action Use Wistia for demo videos, if needed Provide all relevant information on the landing page itself 2. Responsiveness and speed are not negotiable Source: Carrd A good landing page loads fast and looks good on all devices. In 2024, Unbounce carried out a study of over 40000 landing pages and found out that 79% of SaaS landing page visits came from mobile devices.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness. If your website runs on WordPress, use a lightweight theme like Astra or GeneratePress and avoid page builders.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness.

Having a domain name and hosting grants you your own tiny cranny of the Internet that you can completely lord over. Unlike a social media account, you can’t be de-platformed and you don’t really have to deal with people you don’t like. Everyone, I believe, should have at least a blog on their website. It is a plus if the website is self-hosted (although mine isn\u0026rsquo;t).\nWordPress is the most popular option for people who want to build their own website and it is a great option. It is free, powerful, and quite customizable. However, it is overkill for most purposes. For my website, I decided to forego a traditional content management system like WordPress and opt for a static site generator instead.\nA static website is easier and cheaper to host, offers a lot of granularity, and generally loads faster than a comparable dynamic website. Popular static site generators include Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, and Astro.\nMy first choice was Jekyll but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find suitable documentation and it all seemed unwieldy. So, I decided to go with Hugo instead. Hugo is a static site generator written in the Go language. It is indisputably the fastest SSG on the market.\nHugo requires three dependencies: Git, Go, and Sass. I have been spoiled by Windows operating system and I had to get used to working in the terminal. With some Googling, grit, and a little help from Perplexity, I started to get the hang of it.\nI installed the dependencies and by following the instructions in the Quickstart tutorial, I got my first static website up and running. Configuring the website involves changing the default settings in the hugo.toml (or yaml) file and adding new values. I added a theme, wrote some pages, and started putting this post together.\nI have learnt to use git commits to track changes and “back up” my website. I have also brushed my rusty HTML wrangling skills a bit. I understand the Jamstack appeal now.\nThe website isn’t complete yet as at the time of wrting but I am very happy with where it is currently and look forward to bringing my vision to life.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more about Hugo and how it works, check out the official website .

It is part of a specific marketing campaign (social, email, or search) and encourages visitors to take a single, targeted action.\nIt is a proven fact that landing pages are better for conversions than websites. Even if your product’s value proposition is laid out perfectly on your homepage and it fits the ad campaign, you should still use a landing page. Why? Unlike your homepage, a landing page (ideally) has one jumping off point: the call-to-action.\nAn oft-touted statistic from \u0026ldquo;Unbounce \u0026rdquo; says that they checked 455 pages and found that, on average, a dedicated landing page has a 65 percent higher conversion rate than website pages. We have no further information about the study though.\nA detailed case study by \u0026ldquo;Instapage \u0026rdquo; concluded that a dedicated landing page had a conversion rate almost three times (~300%) of a homepage, despite having a lower click-through rate.\nA B2B landing page’s primary purpose is to convert visitors into leads or customers with a promise. Therefore, a dedicated landing page often means higher conversions.\nElements of a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page All landing pages do not convert equally. Just like your software product needs to meet certain requirements, a landing page needs certain elements to be effective:\nPromise: A good landing page must offer a specific promise. This promise must be clear to the audience and address the exact problem they want to solve. Source: Shopify For example, the above landing page by Shopify promises lower costs and business growth. It communicates its message with few words and an eye-catching design.\nThe best B2B SaaS landing pages also have a hero image/section that shows the product in action. The prospect should be able to see themselves using your product’s features and getting results. In practice, this might be a screenshot of the software interface, a picture/illustration of a satisfied user, or a video explaining the benefits of the product. Actual pictures of people using the product are often more powerful.\nSource: Hubstaff Pictures of people tend to be more emotionally appealing than illustrations and visualizations. Research has shown that relevant images of real people can lead to a 95% increase in conversion rates .\nProof: Proof is also vital for a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page. It shows the prospect that you can deliver on the promise. The landing page should have hard numbers and testimonials that communicate your brand’s value. You are leaving money on the table without social proof. Source: Strikingly It is hard to sell a prospect who doesn’t trust you. Your proof should be prominently placed on the landing page, second only to your call to action.\nPull: A strong pull complements the previous two elements. You need an interesting lead magnet and a well-placed call-to-action button. Not every B2B landing page needs a lead magnet, though. If you offer a free trial and/or don’t request for credit card information at sign up, that is the lead magnet.\nSource: Wix canonicalURL: https://tomisinolujinmi.com/posts/who-ruined-search Your lead capture form should be simple and conducive to a frictionless signup. In some cases (enterprise SaaS, especially), you should collect enough information to qualify the lead effectively. If you have a product that has a long sales cycle, asking for just an email address might attract low-quality leads.\nThe goal is to reduce friction without affecting lead quality. You can skip the email funnel entirely and go straight to the sign up and onboarding process.\nBest practices for designing a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page Having the above elements in your landing page doesn’t guarantee that your conversion rates will go through the roof. To make a great meal, it is not enough to have the right ingredients. You need to have them in the right proportion.\nHere is a list of what it takes to create a high-converting landing page for a B2B SaaS audience\n1. Navigation is a no-no Navigation blurs the line between a landing page and a regular website page. It dilutes attention and weakens the emphasis of your campaign. While some big names do it, it is not a recommended practice.\nSource: Quickbooks A landing page should ideally have one link on it – the call-to-action. This is why you should never send traffic to your homepage and why having a dedicated landing page for each campaign cannot be overemphasized.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude a top navigation bar on the landing page Include a YouTube video (distracting and provides a click-away point) Have more than one call-to-action Do:\nHave a single call-to-action Use Wistia for demo videos, if needed Provide all relevant information on the landing page itself 2. Responsiveness and speed are not negotiable Source: Carrd A good landing page loads fast and looks good on all devices. In 2024, Unbounce carried out a study of over 40000 landing pages and found out that 79% of SaaS landing page visits came from mobile devices.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness. If your website runs on WordPress, use a lightweight theme like Astra or GeneratePress and avoid page builders.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness. If your website runs on WordPress, use a lightweight theme like Astra or GeneratePress and avoid page builders.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude everything that has your brand or product’s name on it. Use large images Avoid WordPress page builders like Divi and Elementor (or use a caching plugin) Do:\nUse compressed images, preferably Webp Use a block editor for WordPress Test your page\u0026rsquo;s loading speed with PageSpeed Insights before publishing. 3. Clean, relevant copy complements great design Source: Mailchimp Good copy won\u0026rsquo;t save bad design. The landing page’s design is the first thing the prospect sees. If the design looks good and tenable, then they stick around to read the copy.\nThe copy should talk about your brand, not the competition. A landing page is not where you talk in detail about how your product is much better than the competition. A good B2B landing page should focus on two parties: you and your target customer.\nSource: Zoho Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re at a high-end restaurant and instead of giving you the menu and letting you choose what you\u0026rsquo;d like to eat, the waiter starts talking about how this restaurant is much better than the one down the street. You\u0026rsquo;d probably encourage him to give you the menu and let you come to your own conclusion. It\u0026rsquo;s the same thing with selling B2B SaaS products.\nMost prospects don\u0026rsquo;t care about who you\u0026rsquo;re better than; they just want to get the best value.\nWhile there are no studies on the performance of AI-generated vs human-written copy, a landing page is no place, in my opinion, for the generic content LLMs are known for. AI-assisted copy is generally fine, as long as it feels personal and retains your tone of voice.\n4. A/B testing Always Be Testing. A/B testing, also known as split testing, tests two different versions of a page to see which performs best. With A/B testing, you can tweak different elements on your B2B SaaS landing page (headlines, product images, calls-to-action, etc) and see what makes a difference in overall conversions.\nHowever, be cautious of being hyper-focused on minor details at the expense of the big picture. The majority of copy and design choices will be driven by gut feeling, personal taste, and experience.\nA/B tests should be concentrated on the parts of the landing page that directly influence conversions: copy length, headlines, form fields, call-to-action and key visuals.\nThere are no set rules for A/B testing though. Yourhttps://www.q personal experience and campaign goals should inform the tests you perform.\n5. Keep it simple Source: Brett White/Medium Unbounce’s 2024 Conversion Benchmark Report puts the conversion rate for SaaS landing pages at 3.8%, 42% lower than the industry average of 6.6%. SaaS landing pages are more likely to use complex copy than other industries, leaving prospects confused about the value proposition.\nCopy that is simple and easy to understand converts five times better.\nForget the industry jargon and verbose descriptions. If your product has advanced features that are difficult to explain, opt for a demo video and keep the copy stupid simple.\nIf you found this guide useful, feel free to share it!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/b2b-saas-landing-page/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA B2B SaaS landing page is a focused, standalone web page designed to convert business (B2B) prospects into leads or customers for a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product.

They have taken over from featured snippets as Google’s latest attempt at keeping users on the SERP with zero-click searches.\nAI Overviews have become much better than when they first launched but I still think they are net negative on the search experience and are better off hidden away in a collapsible drop-down menu like People Also Ask.\nThat pretty much sums up my thoughts on AI Overviews. But, do read on if you want to know why I have a gripe with AI overviews:\n1. They are not better than featured snippets AI Overviews feel like a poorly thought-out solution to a problem that doesn’t exist. It is a perfect example of a solution looking for a problem.\nSource: Ben Collins (X) Google already displayed featured snippets prominently at the top of SERPs and while webmasters complained for a while, it was generally seen as the cost of doing business with a profit-driven conglomerate. Google has now replaced the passable featured snippets with slower and far less accurate AI Overviews. It is a downgrade on several levels. I never thought I would miss featured snippets but here we are.\nGoogle Search has become a sorry state of affairs with AI-generated summaries of AI-generated content.\n2. The overviews are scraped content The root of the problem is Google’s decision to compete with publishers for clicks and traffic, similar to most social media platforms.\nGoogle went from being a search engine that allowed people to find interesting websites and articles to scraping the content and publishing it on their SERPs directly. Some people would argue web crawling and web scraping are completely different but I’d argue that there is only a fine distinction.\nGoogle didn’t become a web scraping service until it introduced schema markups which enhanced user experience but blurred the line between the publisher and the medium. They followed up with weather updates and live sports scores before going all in with featured snippets.\nGoogle has been scraping content and stealing traffic from publishers for a while. It is different now because AI Overviews only benefit the company and not the users.\nSoon, Google might stop showing websites entirely and simply display complete articles scraped from different sources .\n3. They are on by default I would be far less bothered with AI Overviews if Google made it easy to turn them off completely.\nThere is the Web (or “udm-14) workaround popularized by Ernie Smith of Tedium, but there is no official setting from Google that allows you to hide AI Overviews from searches across all devices.\nThe official reason is that Google knows what you want better than you do .\nAI Overviews always felt like a feature that Google was pressured to include. For the first time in the history of search, another search engine beat Google to the punch leveraging AI – technology that was a core part of Google’s business. The top guns panicked and had the teams push out a feature that was not close to being ready.\nIt is not exactly groundbreaking technology but it is enough to keep the movers and shakers happy. Turning it off would imply that Google was wrong to include in the first place and egos tend to fly sky high when you are as large as Google.\nTen blue links, how I\u0026rsquo;ve missed you\nThe “Web” results view is unburdened with AI results, for now. You can get a clean list of results by selecting Web from the menu at the bottom of the search bar or by adding “\u0026amp;udm-14” to the search URL. Ernie’s original blog post shows you how to set it up in your browser. TenBlueLinks and Ernie’s udm14 website can also be used as custom search engines. Enjoy it while it lasts.\nTip: You can add -ai to your search query for a quick fix\nSince the fiasco with the rocks and glue eating, Google has been more cautious with displaying AI Overviews. I’ve noticed AI Overviews appear more in informational searches and are less present in searches related to medicine (soon to be changed , finance, and politics.

It is free, powerful, and quite customizable. However, it is overkill for most purposes. For my website, I decided to forego a traditional content management system like WordPress and opt for a static site generator instead.\nA static website is easier and cheaper to host, offers a lot of granularity, and generally loads faster than a comparable dynamic website. Popular static site generators include Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, and Astro.\nMy first choice was Jekyll but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find suitable documentation and it all seemed unwieldy. So, I decided to go with Hugo instead. Hugo is a static site generator written in the Go language. It is indisputably the fastest SSG on the market.\nHugo requires three dependencies: Git, Go, and Sass. I have been spoiled by Windows operating system and I had to get used to working in the terminal. With some Googling, grit, and a little help from Perplexity, I started to get the hang of it.\nI installed the dependencies and by following the instructions in the Quickstart tutorial, I got my first static website up and running. Configuring the website involves changing the default settings in the hugo.toml (or yaml) file and adding new values. I added a theme, wrote some pages, and started putting this post together.\nI have learnt to use git commits to track changes and “back up” my website. I have also brushed my rusty HTML wrangling skills a bit. I understand the Jamstack appeal now.\nThe website isn’t complete yet as at the time of wrting but I am very happy with where it is currently and look forward to bringing my vision to life.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more about Hugo and how it works, check out the official website .

It is part of a specific marketing campaign (social, email, or search) and encourages visitors to take a single, targeted action.\nIt is a proven fact that landing pages are better for conversions than websites. Even if your product’s value proposition is laid out perfectly on your homepage and it fits the ad campaign, you should still use a landing page. Why? Unlike your homepage, a landing page (ideally) has one jumping off point: the call-to-action.\nAn oft-touted statistic from Unbounce says that they checked 455 pages and found that, on average, a dedicated landing page has a 65 percent higher conversion rate than website pages. We have no further information about the study though.\nA detailed case study by Instapage concluded that a dedicated landing page had a conversion rate almost three times (~300%) of a homepage, despite having a lower click-through rate.\nA B2B landing page’s primary purpose is to convert visitors into leads or customers with a promise. Therefore, a dedicated landing page often means higher conversions.\nElements of a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page All landing pages do not convert equally. Just like your software product needs to meet certain requirements, a landing page needs certain elements to be effective:\nPromise: A good landing page must offer a specific promise. This promise must be clear to the audience and address the exact problem they want to solve. Source: Shopify For example, the above landing page by Shopify promises lower costs and business growth. It communicates its message with few words and an eye-catching design.\nThe best B2B SaaS landing pages also have a hero image/section that shows the product in action. The prospect should be able to see themselves using your product’s features and getting results. In practice, this might be a screenshot of the software interface, a picture/illustration of a satisfied user, or a video explaining the benefits of the product. Actual pictures of people using the product are often more powerful.\nSource: Hubstaff Pictures of people tend to be more emotionally appealing than illustrations and visualizations. Research has shown that relevant images of real people can lead to a 95% increase in conversion rates .\nProof: Proof is also vital for a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page. It shows the prospect that you can deliver on the promise. The landing page should have hard numbers and testimonials that communicate your brand’s value. You are leaving money on the table without social proof. Source: Strikingly It is hard to sell a prospect who doesn’t trust you. Your proof should be prominently placed on the landing page, second only to your call to action.\nPull: A strong pull complements the previous two elements. You need an interesting lead magnet and a well-placed call-to-action button. Not every B2B landing page needs a lead magnet, though. If you offer a free trial and/or don’t request for credit card information at sign up, that is the lead magnet.\nSource: Wix canonicalURL: https://tomisinolujinmi.com/posts/who-ruined-search Your lead capture form should be simple and conducive to a frictionless signup. In some cases (enterprise SaaS, especially), you should collect enough information to qualify the lead effectively. If you have a product that has a long sales cycle, asking for just an email address might attract low-quality leads.\nThe goal is to reduce friction without affecting lead quality. You can skip the email funnel entirely and go straight to the sign up and onboarding process.\nBest practices for designing a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page Having the above elements in your landing page doesn’t guarantee that your conversion rates will go through the roof. To make a great meal, it is not enough to have the right ingredients. You need to have them in the right proportion.\nHere is a list of what it takes to create a high-converting landing page for a B2B SaaS audience\n1. Navigation is a no-no Navigation blurs the line between a landing page and a regular website page. It dilutes attention and weakens the emphasis of your campaign. While some big names do it, it is not a recommended practice.\nSource: Quickbooks A landing page should ideally have one link on it – the call-to-action. This is why you should never send traffic to your homepage and why having a dedicated landing page for each campaign cannot be overemphasized.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude a top navigation bar on the landing page Include a YouTube video (distracting and provides a click-away point) Have more than one call-to-action Do:\nHave a single call-to-action Use Wistia for demo videos, if needed Provide all relevant information on the landing page itself 2. Responsiveness and speed are not negotiable Source: Carrd A good landing page loads fast and looks good on all devices. In 2024, Unbounce carried out a study of over 40000 landing pages and found out that 79% of SaaS landing page visits came from mobile devices.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness. If your website runs on WordPress, use a lightweight theme like Astra or GeneratePress and avoid page builders.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness. If your website runs on WordPress, use a lightweight theme like Astra or GeneratePress and avoid page builders.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude everything that has your brand or product’s name on it. Use large images Avoid WordPress page builders like Divi and Elementor (or use a caching plugin) Do:\nUse compressed images, preferably Webp Use a block editor for WordPress Test your page\u0026rsquo;s loading speed with PageSpeed Insights before publishing. 3. Clean, relevant copy complements great design Source: Mailchimp Good copy won\u0026rsquo;t save bad design. The landing page’s design is the first thing the prospect sees. If the design looks good and tenable, then they stick around to read the copy.\nThe copy should talk about your brand, not the competition. A landing page is not where you talk in detail about how your product is much better than the competition. A good B2B landing page should focus on two parties: you and your target customer.\nSource: Zoho Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re at a high-end restaurant and instead of giving you the menu and letting you choose what you\u0026rsquo;d like to eat, the waiter starts talking about how this restaurant is much better than the one down the street. You\u0026rsquo;d probably encourage him to give you the menu and let you come to your own conclusion. It\u0026rsquo;s the same thing with selling B2B SaaS products.\nMost prospects don\u0026rsquo;t care about who you\u0026rsquo;re better than; they just want to get the best value.\nWhile there are no studies on the performance of AI-generated vs human-written copy, a landing page is no place, in my opinion, for the generic content LLMs are known for. AI-assisted copy is generally fine, as long as it feels personal and retains your tone of voice.\n4. A/B testing Always Be Testing. A/B testing, also known as split testing, tests two different versions of a page to see which performs best. With A/B testing, you can tweak different elements on your B2B SaaS landing page (headlines, product images, calls-to-action, etc) and see what makes a difference in overall conversions.\nHowever, be cautious of being hyper-focused on minor details at the expense of the big picture. The majority of copy and design choices will be driven by gut feeling, personal taste, and experience.\nA/B tests should be concentrated on the parts of the landing page that directly influence conversions: copy length, headlines, form fields, call-to-action and key visuals.\nThere are no set rules for A/B testing though. Yourhttps://www.q personal experience and campaign goals should inform the tests you perform.\n5. Keep it simple Source: Brett White/Medium Unbounce’s 2024 Conversion Benchmark Report puts the conversion rate for SaaS landing pages at 3.8%, 42% lower than the industry average of 6.6%. SaaS landing pages are more likely to use complex copy than other industries, leaving prospects confused about the value proposition.\nCopy that is simple and easy to understand converts five times better.\nForget the industry jargon and verbose descriptions. If your product has advanced features that are difficult to explain, opt for a demo video and keep the copy stupid simple.\nIf you found this guide useful, feel free to share it!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/b2b-saas-landing-page/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA B2B SaaS landing page is a focused, standalone web page designed to convert business (B2B) prospects into leads or customers for a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product.

They have taken over from featured snippets as Google’s latest attempt at keeping users on the SERP with zero-click searches.\nAI Overviews have become much better than when they first launched but I still think they are net negative on the search experience and are better off hidden away in a collapsible drop-down menu like People Also Ask.\nThat pretty much sums up my thoughts on AI Overviews. But, do read on if you want to know why I have a gripe with AI overviews:\n1. They are not better than featured snippets AI Overviews feel like a poorly thought-out solution to a problem that doesn’t exist. It is a perfect example of a solution looking for a problem.\nSource: Ben Collins (X) Google already displayed featured snippets prominently at the top of SERPs and while webmasters complained for a while, it was generally seen as the cost of doing business with a profit-driven conglomerate. Google has now replaced the passable featured snippets with slower and far less accurate AI Overviews. It is a downgrade on several levels. I never thought I would miss featured snippets but here we are.\nGoogle Search has become a sorry state of affairs with AI-generated summaries of AI-generated content.\n2. The overviews are scraped content The root of the problem is Google’s decision to compete with publishers for clicks and traffic, similar to most social media platforms.\nGoogle went from being a search engine that allowed people to find interesting websites and articles to scraping the content and publishing it on their SERPs directly. Some people would argue web crawling and web scraping are completely different but I’d argue that there is only a fine distinction.\nGoogle didn’t become a web scraping service until it introduced schema markups which enhanced user experience but blurred the line between the publisher and the medium. They followed up with weather updates and live sports scores before going all in with featured snippets.\nGoogle has been scraping content and stealing traffic from publishers for a while. It is different now because AI Overviews only benefit the company and not the users.\nSoon, Google might stop showing websites entirely and simply display complete articles scraped from different sources .\n3. They are on by default I would be far less bothered with AI Overviews if Google made it easy to turn them off completely.\nThere is the Web (or “udm-14) workaround popularized by Ernie Smith of Tedium, but there is no official setting from Google that allows you to hide AI Overviews from searches across all devices.\nThe official reason is that Google knows what you want better than you do .\nAI Overviews always felt like a feature that Google was pressured to include. For the first time in the history of search, another search engine beat Google to the punch leveraging AI – technology that was a core part of Google’s business. The top guns panicked and had the teams push out a feature that was not close to being ready.\nIt is not exactly groundbreaking technology but it is enough to keep the movers and shakers happy. Turning it off would imply that Google was wrong to include in the first place and egos tend to fly sky high when you are as large as Google.\nTen blue links, how I\u0026rsquo;ve missed you\nThe “Web” results view is unburdened with AI results, for now. You can get a clean list of results by selecting Web from the menu at the bottom of the search bar or by adding “\u0026amp;udm-14” to the search URL. Ernie’s original blog post shows you how to set it up in your browser. TenBlueLinks and Ernie’s udm14 website can also be used as custom search engines. Enjoy it while it lasts.\nTip: You can add -ai to your search query for a quick fix\nSince the fiasco with the rocks and glue eating, Google has been more cautious with displaying AI Overviews. I’ve noticed AI Overviews appear more in informational searches and are less present in searches related to medicine (soon to be changed , finance, and politics. Due to how LLMs work, overviews also do not appear for breaking news or trending content.

While its competitors were cluttered, ad-ridden web portals, Google had one specific purpose, and it did it well.\nThis was what Google looked like then:\nSource: Google Search Blog Today, Google’s search engine is partly an AI chatbot and partly a portal to Reddit. Ads are displayed prominently above the fold. The top search results are fluffy, long-form content ranking primarily because of the number of keywords and backlinks on the page. Despite the company\u0026rsquo;s best efforts to convince us otherwise, Google cannot reliably infer content quality. Therefore, the algorithm has to make do with other less important and more easily faked signals.\nSince businesses started getting on the Web, it has been a dance between Google and SEOs with each end trying to get the better of the other. Google would release a new algorithm update and SEO experts would try to reverse-engineer it based on their observations and opinions.\nThese observations would become tactics and strategies, and if you had a website that relied on getting traffic from Google, you had to pay attention. Occasionally, Google would release a guide with some helpful tips and some intentionally vague advice like “Make your site interesting and useful.” The company encouraged search engine optimization, as long as you didn\u0026rsquo;t game the system. However, the simple truth is, that if there is a loophole, people will try to exploit it.\nSource: Google\u0026rsquo;s SEO Starter Guide There have several SEO techniques over the years, ranging from straight keyword stuffing to image tags. However, the most prevalent by far has been publishing long-form content. SEOs figured out that the most reliable way to rank high on Google was to write the best article on the topic.\nIt became common to see 2000+ word articles trying to cover every possible search intent with semantic keywords and unnecessary FAQ lists. Recipe pages would include long stories to convince the search algorithm that their content was the most in-depth and relevant. And the worst part (or best, depending on who you ask) is that it worked!\nIt worked because Google was too busy trying to keep the audience’s attention on the increasingly visible ads on the SERPs to ensure that webmasters were writing content for people and not their algorithm.\nBefore the Helpful Content update, if you wrote a 3000-word article filled with semantic keywords and attention-grabbing images/videos, your article was guaranteed to rank. If your competitors caught up to you, you would add more words. Rinse and repeat.\nThe system ran on for a while. A good number of web content writers got paid by the word and were incentivized to write more words. Businesses got to rank on the first page of Google, so they had no reason to change what worked. SEO experts and service providers were able to create a bloated and overpriced industry. But web users were getting the short end of the stick with fluffy, uninteresting, and arduous-to-read content that had forgotten who it was meant to serve.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t explicitly blame SEOs for the turn of events. Behind the scenes, Google has been focused on solving one problem: maximizing profit potential from ad revenue. Google was too busy stealing answers with featured snippets (later AI Overviews) from creators to notice the growing attention issue they had contributed to.\nAs early as 2019, savvy users discovered that adding ‘site:reddit.com’ or simply ‘Reddit’ to their searches was the best way to skip the ads and 2500-word articles to get the actual answer they were looking for. Perhaps if they had the resources, Reddit Inc. could have created a worthwhile competitor to Google Search. Google would later add a ‘Discussions and forums’ section in late 2022 and would begin boosting Reddit and Quora in 2023.\nIn his popular piece \"The Man Who Killed Google Search\", Ed Zitron posits a name he believes was responsible for the current of search: Prabhakar Raghavan. However, I am inclined to disagree. Scapegoats are very easy to find and the real problem likely runs much deeper. Let\u0026rsquo;s see who is behind that mask\nAt the end of the day, Google itself ruined Google Search, and the company has no current incentive to fix it.\nSo, what can we do about it? We can start by using Google\u0026rsquo;s proprietary products less, writing helpful content for people and promoting it actively. You can go a step further and install a custom ROM (LineageOS and /e/OS are good options) on your Android device to shake things up a bit. Between us and the LLM chatbots, I\u0026rsquo;d wager that we could go some damage to the conglomerate.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/who-ruined-search/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eGoogle displaced other search engines by leveraging a simple, minimalistic interface and superior search algorithm.

Navigation is a no-no Navigation blurs the line between a landing page and a regular website page. It dilutes attention and weakens the emphasis of your campaign. While some big names do it, it is not a recommended practice.\nSource: Quickbooks A landing page should ideally have one link on it – the call-to-action.

The majority of copy and design choices will be driven by gut feeling, personal taste, and experience.\nA/B tests should be concentrated on the parts of the landing page that directly influence conversions: copy length, headlines, form fields, call-to-action and key visuals.\nThere are no set rules for A/B testing though.

The top guns panicked and had the teams push out a feature that was not close to being ready.\nIt is not exactly groundbreaking technology but it is enough to keep the movers and shakers happy.

While its competitors were cluttered, ad-ridden web portals, Google had one specific purpose, and it did it well.\nThis was what Google looked like then:\nSource: Google Search Blog Today, Google’s search engine is partly an AI chatbot and partly a portal to Reddit. Ads are displayed prominently above the fold. The top search results are fluffy, long-form content ranking primarily because of the number of keywords and backlinks on the page. Despite the company\u0026rsquo;s best efforts to convince us otherwise, Google cannot reliably infer content quality. Therefore, the algorithm has to make do with other less important and more easily faked signals.\nSince businesses started getting on the Web, it has been a dance between Google and SEOs with each end trying to get the better of the other. Google would release a new algorithm update and SEO experts would try to reverse-engineer it based on their observations and opinions.\nThese observations would become tactics and strategies, and if you had a website that relied on getting traffic from Google, you had to pay attention. Occasionally, Google would release a guide with some helpful tips and some intentionally vague advice like “Make your site interesting and useful.” The company encouraged search engine optimization, as long as you didn\u0026rsquo;t game the system. However, the simple truth is, that if there is a loophole, people will try to exploit it.\nSource: Google\u0026rsquo;s SEO Starter Guide There have several SEO techniques over the years, ranging from straight keyword stuffing to image tags. However, the most prevalent by far has been publishing long-form content. SEOs figured out that the most reliable way to rank high on Google was to write the best article on the topic.\nIt became common to see 2000+ word articles trying to cover every possible search intent with semantic keywords and unnecessary FAQ lists. Recipe pages would include long stories to convince the search algorithm that their content was the most in-depth and relevant. And the worst part (or best, depending on who you ask) is that it worked!\nIt worked because Google was too busy trying to keep the audience’s attention on the increasingly visible ads on the SERPs to ensure that webmasters were writing content for people and not their algorithm.\nBefore the Helpful Content update, if you wrote a 3000-word article filled with semantic keywords and attention-grabbing images/videos, your article was guaranteed to rank. If your competitors caught up to you, you would add more words. Rinse and repeat.\nThe system ran on for a while. A good number of web content writers got paid by the word and were incentivized to write more words. Businesses got to rank on the first page of Google, so they had no reason to change what worked. SEO experts and service providers were able to create a bloated and overpriced industry. But web users were getting the short end of the stick with fluffy, uninteresting, and arduous-to-read content that had forgotten who it was meant to serve.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t explicitly blame SEOs for the turn of events. Behind the scenes, Google has been focused on solving one problem: maximizing profit potential from ad revenue. Google was too busy stealing answers with featured snippets (later AI Overviews) from creators to notice the growing attention issue they had contributed to.\nAs early as 2019, savvy users discovered that adding ‘site:reddit.com’ or simply ‘Reddit’ to their searches was the best way to skip the ads and 2500-word articles to get the actual answer they were looking for. Perhaps if they had the resources, Reddit Inc. could have created a worthwhile competitor to Google Search. Google would later add a ‘Discussions and forums’ section in late 2022 and would begin boosting Reddit and Quora in 2023.\nIn his popular piece \"The Man Who Killed Google Search\", Ed Zitron posits a name he believes was responsible for the current of search: Prabhakar Raghavan. However, I am inclined to disagree. Scapegoats are very easy to find and the real problem likely runs much deeper. Let\u0026rsquo;s see who is behind that mask\nAt the end of the day, Google itself ruined Google Search, and the company has no current incentive to fix it.\nSo, what can we do about it? We can start by using Google\u0026rsquo;s proprietary products less, writing helpful content for people and promoting it actively. You can go a step further and install a custom ROM (LineageOS and /e/OS are good options) on your Android device to shake things up a bit. Between us and the LLM chatbots, I\u0026rsquo;d wager that we could go some damage to the conglomerate.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/who-ruined-search/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eGoogle displaced other search engines by leveraging a simple, minimalistic interface and superior search algorithm.

Having a domain name and hosting grants you your own tiny cranny of the Internet that you can completely lord over. Unlike a social media account, you can’t be de-platformed and you don’t really have to deal with people you don’t like. Everyone, I believe, should have at least a blog on their website. It is a plus if the website is self-hosted (although mine isn\u0026rsquo;t).\nWordPress is the most popular option for people who want to build their own website and it is a great option. It is free, powerful, and quite customizable. However, it is overkill for most purposes. For my website, I decided to forego a traditional content management system like WordPress and opt for a static site generator instead.\nA static website is easier and cheaper to host, offers a lot of granularity, and generally loads faster than a comparable dynamic website. Popular static site generators include Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, and Astro.\nMy first choice was Jekyll but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find suitable documentation and it all seemed unwieldy. So, I decided to go with Hugo instead. Hugo is a static site generator written in the Go language. It is indisputably the fastest SSG on the market.\nHugo requires three dependencies: Git, Go, and Sass. I have been spoiled by Windows operating system and I had to get used to working in the terminal. With some Googling, grit, and a little help from Perplexity, I started to get the hang of it.\nI installed the dependencies and by following the instructions in the Quickstart tutorial, I got my first static website up and running. Configuring the website involves changing the default settings in the hugo.toml (or yaml) file and adding new values. I added a theme, wrote some pages, and started putting this post together.\nI have learnt to use git commits to track changes and “back up” my website. I have also brushed my rusty HTML wrangling skills a bit. I understand the Jamstack appeal now.\nThe website isn’t complete yet as at the time of wrting but I am very happy with where it is currently and look forward to bringing my vision to life.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more about Hugo and how it works, check out the official website .

Even if your product’s value proposition is laid out perfectly on your homepage and it fits the ad campaign, you should still use a landing page. Why? Unlike your homepage, a landing page (ideally) has one jumping off point: the call-to-action.\nAn oft-touted statistic from Unbounce says that they checked 455 pages and found that, on average, a dedicated landing page has a 65 percent higher conversion rate than website pages. We have no further information about the study though.\nA detailed case study by Instapage concluded that a dedicated landing page had a conversion rate almost three times (~300%) of a homepage, despite having a lower click-through rate.\nA B2B landing page’s primary purpose is to convert visitors into leads or customers with a promise. Therefore, a dedicated landing page often means higher conversions.\nElements of a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page All landing pages do not convert equally. Just like your software product needs to meet certain requirements, a landing page needs certain elements to be effective:\nPromise: A good landing page must offer a specific promise. This promise must be clear to the audience and address the exact problem they want to solve. Source: Shopify For example, the above landing page by Shopify promises lower costs and business growth. It communicates its message with few words and an eye-catching design.\nThe best B2B SaaS landing pages also have a hero image/section that shows the product in action. The prospect should be able to see themselves using your product’s features and getting results. In practice, this might be a screenshot of the software interface, a picture/illustration of a satisfied user, or a video explaining the benefits of the product. Actual pictures of people using the product are often more powerful.\nSource: Hubstaff Pictures of people tend to be more emotionally appealing than illustrations and visualizations. Research has shown that relevant images of real people can lead to a 95% increase in conversion rates .\nProof: Proof is also vital for a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page. It shows the prospect that you can deliver on the promise. The landing page should have hard numbers and testimonials that communicate your brand’s value. You are leaving money on the table without social proof. Source: Strikingly It is hard to sell a prospect who doesn’t trust you. Your proof should be prominently placed on the landing page, second only to your call to action.\nPull: A strong pull complements the previous two elements. You need an interesting lead magnet and a well-placed call-to-action button. Not every B2B landing page needs a lead magnet, though. If you offer a free trial and/or don’t request for credit card information at sign up, that is the lead magnet.\nSource: Wix canonicalURL: https://tomisinolujinmi.com/posts/who-ruined-search Your lead capture form should be simple and conducive to a frictionless signup. In some cases (enterprise SaaS, especially), you should collect enough information to qualify the lead effectively. If you have a product that has a long sales cycle, asking for just an email address might attract low-quality leads.\nThe goal is to reduce friction without affecting lead quality.

Having a domain name and hosting grants you your own tiny cranny of the Internet that you can completely lord over. Unlike a social media account, you can’t be de-platformed and you don’t really have to deal with people you don’t like. Everyone, I believe, should have at least a blog on their website. It is a plus if the website is self-hosted (although mine isn\u0026rsquo;t).\nWordPress is the most popular option for people who want to build their own website and it is a great option. It is free, powerful, and quite customizable. However, it is overkill for most purposes. For my website, I decided to forego a traditional content management system like WordPress and opt for a static site generator instead.\nA static website is easier and cheaper to host, offers a lot of granularity, and generally loads faster than a comparable dynamic website. Popular static site generators include Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, and Astro.\nMy first choice was Jekyll but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find suitable documentation and it all seemed unwieldy. So, I decided to go with Hugo instead. Hugo is a static site generator written in the Go language. It is indisputably the fastest SSG on the market.\nHugo requires three dependencies: Git, Go, and Sass. I have been spoiled by Windows operating system and I had to get used to working in the terminal. With some Googling, grit, and a little help from Perplexity, I started to get the hang of it.\nI installed the dependencies and by following the instructions in the Quickstart tutorial, I got my first static website up and running. Configuring the website involves changing the default settings in the hugo.toml (or yaml) file and adding new values. I added a theme, wrote some pages, and started putting this post together.\nI have learnt to use git commits to track changes and “back up” my website. I have also brushed my rusty HTML wrangling skills a bit. I understand the Jamstack appeal now.\nThe website isn’t complete yet as at the time of wrting but I am very happy with where it is currently and look forward to bringing my vision to life.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more about Hugo and how it works, check out the official website .

It is part of a specific marketing campaign (social, email, or search) and encourages visitors to take a single, targeted action.\nIt is a proven fact that landing pages are better for conversions than websites. Even if your product’s value proposition is laid out perfectly on your homepage and it fits the ad campaign, you should still use a landing page. Why? Unlike your homepage, a landing page (ideally) has one jumping off point: the call-to-action.\nAn oft-touted statistic from Unbounce says that they checked 455 pages and found that, on average, a dedicated landing page has a 65 percent higher conversion rate than website pages. We have no further information about the study though.\nA detailed case study by Instapage concluded that a dedicated landing page had a conversion rate almost three times (~300%) of a homepage, despite having a lower click-through rate.\nA B2B landing page’s primary purpose is to convert visitors into leads or customers with a promise. Therefore, a dedicated landing page often means higher conversions.\nElements of a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page All landing pages do not convert equally. Just like your software product needs to meet certain requirements, a landing page needs certain elements to be effective:\nPromise: A good landing page must offer a specific promise. This promise must be clear to the audience and address the exact problem they want to solve. Source: Shopify For example, the above landing page by Shopify promises lower costs and business growth. It communicates its message with few words and an eye-catching design.\nThe best B2B SaaS landing pages also have a hero image/section that shows the product in action. The prospect should be able to see themselves using your product’s features and getting results. In practice, this might be a screenshot of the software interface, a picture/illustration of a satisfied user, or a video explaining the benefits of the product. Actual pictures of people using the product are often more powerful.\nSource: Hubstaff Pictures of people tend to be more emotionally appealing than illustrations and visualizations. Research has shown that relevant images of real people can lead to a 95% increase in conversion rates .\nProof: Proof is also vital for a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page. It shows the prospect that you can deliver on the promise. The landing page should have hard numbers and testimonials that communicate your brand’s value. You are leaving money on the table without social proof. Source: Strikingly It is hard to sell a prospect who doesn’t trust you. Your proof should be prominently placed on the landing page, second only to your call to action.\nPull: A strong pull complements the previous two elements. You need an interesting lead magnet and a well-placed call-to-action button. Not every B2B landing page needs a lead magnet, though. If you offer a free trial and/or don’t request for credit card information at sign up, that is the lead magnet.\nSource: Wix canonicalURL: https://tomisinolujinmi.com/posts/who-ruined-search Your lead capture form should be simple and conducive to a frictionless signup. In some cases (enterprise SaaS, especially), you should collect enough information to qualify the lead effectively. If you have a product that has a long sales cycle, asking for just an email address might attract low-quality leads.\nThe goal is to reduce friction without affecting lead quality. You can skip the email funnel entirely and go straight to the sign up and onboarding process.\nBest practices for designing a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page Having the above elements in your landing page doesn’t guarantee that your conversion rates will go through the roof. To make a great meal, it is not enough to have the right ingredients. You need to have them in the right proportion.\nHere is a list of what it takes to create a high-converting landing page for a B2B SaaS audience\n1. Navigation is a no-no Navigation blurs the line between a landing page and a regular website page. It dilutes attention and weakens the emphasis of your campaign. While some big names do it, it is not a recommended practice.\nSource: Quickbooks A landing page should ideally have one link on it – the call-to-action. This is why you should never send traffic to your homepage and why having a dedicated landing page for each campaign cannot be overemphasized.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude a top navigation bar on the landing page Include a YouTube video (distracting and provides a click-away point) Have more than one call-to-action Do:\nHave a single call-to-action Use Wistia for demo videos, if needed Provide all relevant information on the landing page itself 2. Responsiveness and speed are not negotiable Source: Carrd A good landing page loads fast and looks good on all devices. In 2024, Unbounce carried out a study of over 40000 landing pages and found out that 79% of SaaS landing page visits came from mobile devices.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness. If your website runs on WordPress, use a lightweight theme like Astra or GeneratePress and avoid page builders.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness. If your website runs on WordPress, use a lightweight theme like Astra or GeneratePress and avoid page builders.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude everything that has your brand or product’s name on it. Use large images Avoid WordPress page builders like Divi and Elementor (or use a caching plugin) Do:\nUse compressed images, preferably Webp Use a block editor for WordPress Test your page\u0026rsquo;s loading speed with PageSpeed Insights before publishing. 3. Clean, relevant copy complements great design Source: Mailchimp Good copy won\u0026rsquo;t save bad design. The landing page’s design is the first thing the prospect sees. If the design looks good and tenable, then they stick around to read the copy.\nThe copy should talk about your brand, not the competition. A landing page is not where you talk in detail about how your product is much better than the competition. A good B2B landing page should focus on two parties: you and your target customer.\nSource: Zoho Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re at a high-end restaurant and instead of giving you the menu and letting you choose what you\u0026rsquo;d like to eat, the waiter starts talking about how this restaurant is much better than the one down the street. You\u0026rsquo;d probably encourage him to give you the menu and let you come to your own conclusion. It\u0026rsquo;s the same thing with selling B2B SaaS products.\nMost prospects don\u0026rsquo;t care about who you\u0026rsquo;re better than; they just want to get the best value.\nWhile there are no studies on the performance of AI-generated vs human-written copy, a landing page is no place, in my opinion, for the generic content LLMs are known for. AI-assisted copy is generally fine, as long as it feels personal and retains your tone of voice.\n4. A/B testing Always Be Testing. A/B testing, also known as split testing, tests two different versions of a page to see which performs best. With A/B testing, you can tweak different elements on your B2B SaaS landing page (headlines, product images, calls-to-action, etc) and see what makes a difference in overall conversions.\nHowever, be cautious of being hyper-focused on minor details at the expense of the big picture. The majority of copy and design choices will be driven by gut feeling, personal taste, and experience.\nA/B tests should be concentrated on the parts of the landing page that directly influence conversions: copy length, headlines, form fields, call-to-action and key visuals.\nThere are no set rules for A/B testing though. Yourhttps://www.q personal experience and campaign goals should inform the tests you perform.\n5. Keep it simple Source: Brett White/Medium Unbounce’s 2024 Conversion Benchmark Report puts the conversion rate for SaaS landing pages at 3.8%, 42% lower than the industry average of 6.6%. SaaS landing pages are more likely to use complex copy than other industries, leaving prospects confused about the value proposition.\nCopy that is simple and easy to understand converts five times better.\nForget the industry jargon and verbose descriptions. If your product has advanced features that are difficult to explain, opt for a demo video and keep the copy stupid simple.\nIf you found this guide useful, feel free to share it!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/b2b-saas-landing-page/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA B2B SaaS landing page is a focused, standalone web page designed to convert business (B2B) prospects into leads or customers for a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product.

It is part of a specific marketing campaign (social, email, or search) and encourages visitors to take a single, targeted action.\nIt is a proven fact that landing pages are better for conversions than websites. Even if your product’s value proposition is laid out perfectly on your homepage and it fits the ad campaign, you should still use a landing page. Why? Unlike your homepage, a landing page (ideally) has one jumping off point: the call-to-action.\nAn oft-touted statistic from Unbounce says that they checked 455 pages and found that, on average, a dedicated landing page has a 65 percent higher conversion rate than website pages. We have no further information about the study though.\nA detailed case study by Instapage concluded that a dedicated landing page had a conversion rate almost three times (~300%) of a homepage, despite having a lower click-through rate.\nA B2B landing page’s primary purpose is to convert visitors into leads or customers with a promise. Therefore, a dedicated landing page often means higher conversions.\nElements of a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page All landing pages do not convert equally. Just like your software product needs to meet certain requirements, a landing page needs certain elements to be effective:\nPromise: A good landing page must offer a specific promise. This promise must be clear to the audience and address the exact problem they want to solve. Source: Shopify For example, the above landing page by Shopify promises lower costs and business growth. It communicates its message with few words and an eye-catching design.\nThe best B2B SaaS landing pages also have a hero image/section that shows the product in action. The prospect should be able to see themselves using your product’s features and getting results. In practice, this might be a screenshot of the software interface, a picture/illustration of a satisfied user, or a video explaining the benefits of the product. Actual pictures of people using the product are often more powerful.\nSource: Hubstaff Pictures of people tend to be more emotionally appealing than illustrations and visualizations. Research has shown that relevant images of real people can lead to a 95% increase in conversion rates .\nProof: Proof is also vital for a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page. It shows the prospect that you can deliver on the promise. The landing page should have hard numbers and testimonials that communicate your brand’s value. You are leaving money on the table without social proof. Source: Strikingly It is hard to sell a prospect who doesn’t trust you. Your proof should be prominently placed on the landing page, second only to your call to action.\nPull: A strong pull complements the previous two elements. You need an interesting lead magnet and a well-placed call-to-action button. Not every B2B landing page needs a lead magnet, though. If you offer a free trial and/or don’t request for credit card information at sign up, that is the lead magnet.\nSource: Wix canonicalURL: https://tomisinolujinmi.com/posts/who-ruined-search Your lead capture form should be simple and conducive to a frictionless signup. In some cases (enterprise SaaS, especially), you should collect enough information to qualify the lead effectively. If you have a product that has a long sales cycle, asking for just an email address might attract low-quality leads.\nThe goal is to reduce friction without affecting lead quality. You can skip the email funnel entirely and go straight to the sign up and onboarding process.\nBest practices for designing a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page Having the above elements in your landing page doesn’t guarantee that your conversion rates will go through the roof. To make a great meal, it is not enough to have the right ingredients. You need to have them in the right proportion.\nHere is a list of what it takes to create a high-converting landing page for a B2B SaaS audience\n1. Navigation is a no-no Navigation blurs the line between a landing page and a regular website page. It dilutes attention and weakens the emphasis of your campaign. While some big names do it, it is not a recommended practice.\nSource: Quickbooks A landing page should ideally have one link on it – the call-to-action. This is why you should never send traffic to your homepage and why having a dedicated landing page for each campaign cannot be overemphasized.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude a top navigation bar on the landing page Include a YouTube video (distracting and provides a click-away point) Have more than one call-to-action Do:\nHave a single call-to-action Use Wistia for demo videos, if needed Provide all relevant information on the landing page itself 2. Responsiveness and speed are not negotiable Source: Carrd A good landing page loads fast and looks good on all devices. In 2024, Unbounce carried out a study of over 40000 landing pages and found out that 79% of SaaS landing page visits came from mobile devices.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness. If your website runs on WordPress, use a lightweight theme like Astra or GeneratePress and avoid page builders.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness. If your website runs on WordPress, use a lightweight theme like Astra or GeneratePress and avoid page builders.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude everything that has your brand or product’s name on it. Use large images Avoid WordPress page builders like Divi and Elementor (or use a caching plugin) Do:\nUse compressed images, preferably Webp Use a block editor for WordPress Test your page\u0026rsquo;s loading speed with PageSpeed Insights before publishing. 3. Clean, relevant copy complements great design Source: Mailchimp Good copy won\u0026rsquo;t save bad design. The landing page’s design is the first thing the prospect sees. If the design looks good and tenable, then they stick around to read the copy.\nThe copy should talk about your brand, not the competition. A landing page is not where you talk in detail about how your product is much better than the competition. A good B2B landing page should focus on two parties: you and your target customer.\nSource: Zoho Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re at a high-end restaurant and instead of giving you the menu and letting you choose what you\u0026rsquo;d like to eat, the waiter starts talking about how this restaurant is much better than the one down the street. You\u0026rsquo;d probably encourage him to give you the menu and let you come to your own conclusion. It\u0026rsquo;s the same thing with selling B2B SaaS products.\nMost prospects don\u0026rsquo;t care about who you\u0026rsquo;re better than; they just want to get the best value.\nWhile there are no studies on the performance of AI-generated vs human-written copy, a landing page is no place, in my opinion, for the generic content LLMs are known for. AI-assisted copy is generally fine, as long as it feels personal and retains your tone of voice.\n4. A/B testing Always Be Testing. A/B testing, also known as split testing, tests two different versions of a page to see which performs best. With A/B testing, you can tweak different elements on your B2B SaaS landing page (headlines, product images, calls-to-action, etc) and see what makes a difference in overall conversions.\nHowever, be cautious of being hyper-focused on minor details at the expense of the big picture. The majority of copy and design choices will be driven by gut feeling, personal taste, and experience.\nA/B tests should be concentrated on the parts of the landing page that directly influence conversions: copy length, headlines, form fields, call-to-action and key visuals.\nThere are no set rules for A/B testing though. Yourhttps://www.q personal experience and campaign goals should inform the tests you perform.\n5. Keep it simple Source: Brett White/Medium Unbounce’s 2024 Conversion Benchmark Report puts the conversion rate for SaaS landing pages at 3.8%, 42% lower than the industry average of 6.6%. SaaS landing pages are more likely to use complex copy than other industries, leaving prospects confused about the value proposition.\nCopy that is simple and easy to understand converts five times better.\nForget the industry jargon and verbose descriptions. If your product has advanced features that are difficult to explain, opt for a demo video and keep the copy stupid simple.\nIf you found this guide useful, feel free to share it!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/b2b-saas-landing-page/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA B2B SaaS landing page is a focused, standalone web page designed to convert business (B2B) prospects into leads or customers for a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product.

They have taken over from featured snippets as Google’s latest attempt at keeping users on the SERP with zero-click searches.\nAI Overviews have become much better than when they first launched but I still think they are net negative on the search experience and are better off hidden away in a collapsible drop-down menu like People Also Ask.\nThat pretty much sums up my thoughts on AI Overviews. But, do read on if you want to know why I have a gripe with AI overviews:\n1. They are not better than featured snippets AI Overviews feel like a poorly thought-out solution to a problem that doesn’t exist. It is a perfect example of a solution looking for a problem.\nSource: Ben Collins (X) Google already displayed featured snippets prominently at the top of SERPs and while webmasters complained for a while, it was generally seen as the cost of doing business with a profit-driven conglomerate. Google has now replaced the passable featured snippets with slower and far less accurate AI Overviews. It is a downgrade on several levels. I never thought I would miss featured snippets but here we are.\nGoogle Search has become a sorry state of affairs with AI-generated summaries of AI-generated content.\n2. The overviews are scraped content The root of the problem is Google’s decision to compete with publishers for clicks and traffic, similar to most social media platforms.\nGoogle went from being a search engine that allowed people to find interesting websites and articles to scraping the content and publishing it on their SERPs directly. Some people would argue web crawling and web scraping are completely different but I’d argue that there is only a fine distinction.\nGoogle didn’t become a web scraping service until it introduced schema markups which enhanced user experience but blurred the line between the publisher and the medium. They followed up with weather updates and live sports scores before going all in with featured snippets.\nGoogle has been scraping content and stealing traffic from publishers for a while. It is different now because AI Overviews only benefit the company and not the users.\nSoon, Google might stop showing websites entirely and simply display complete articles scraped from different sources .\n3. They are on by default I would be far less bothered with AI Overviews if Google made it easy to turn them off completely.\nThere is the Web (or “udm-14) workaround popularized by Ernie Smith of Tedium, but there is no official setting from Google that allows you to hide AI Overviews from searches across all devices.\nThe official reason is that Google knows what you want better than you do .\nAI Overviews always felt like a feature that Google was pressured to include. For the first time in the history of search, another search engine beat Google to the punch leveraging AI – technology that was a core part of Google’s business. The top guns panicked and had the teams push out a feature that was not close to being ready.\nIt is not exactly groundbreaking technology but it is enough to keep the movers and shakers happy. Turning it off would imply that Google was wrong to include in the first place and egos tend to fly sky high when you are as large as Google.\nTen blue links, how I\u0026rsquo;ve missed you\nThe “Web” results view is unburdened with AI results, for now. You can get a clean list of results by selecting Web from the menu at the bottom of the search bar or by adding “\u0026amp;udm-14” to the search URL. Ernie’s original blog post shows you how to set it up in your browser. TenBlueLinks and Ernie’s udm14 website can also be used as custom search engines. Enjoy it while it lasts.\nTip: You can add -ai to your search query for a quick fix\nSince the fiasco with the rocks and glue eating, Google has been more cautious with displaying AI Overviews. I’ve noticed AI Overviews appear more in informational searches and are less present in searches related to medicine (soon to be changed , finance, and politics. Due to how LLMs work, overviews also do not appear for breaking news or trending content.

Ads are displayed prominently above the fold. The top search results are fluffy, long-form content ranking primarily because of the number of keywords and backlinks on the page. Despite the company\u0026rsquo;s best efforts to convince us otherwise, Google cannot reliably infer content quality. Therefore, the algorithm has to make do with other less important and more easily faked signals.\nSince businesses started getting on the Web, it has been a dance between Google and SEOs with each end trying to get the better of the other. Google would release a new algorithm update and SEO experts would try to reverse-engineer it based on their observations and opinions.\nThese observations would become tactics and strategies, and if you had a website that relied on getting traffic from Google, you had to pay attention. Occasionally, Google would release a guide with some helpful tips and some intentionally vague advice like “Make your site interesting and useful.” The company encouraged search engine optimization, as long as you didn\u0026rsquo;t game the system. However, the simple truth is, that if there is a loophole, people will try to exploit it.\nSource: Google\u0026rsquo;s SEO Starter Guide There have several SEO techniques over the years, ranging from straight keyword stuffing to image tags. However, the most prevalent by far has been publishing long-form content. SEOs figured out that the most reliable way to rank high on Google was to write the best article on the topic.\nIt became common to see 2000+ word articles trying to cover every possible search intent with semantic keywords and unnecessary FAQ lists. Recipe pages would include long stories to convince the search algorithm that their content was the most in-depth and relevant. And the worst part (or best, depending on who you ask) is that it worked!\nIt worked because Google was too busy trying to keep the audience’s attention on the increasingly visible ads on the SERPs to ensure that webmasters were writing content for people and not their algorithm.\nBefore the Helpful Content update, if you wrote a 3000-word article filled with semantic keywords and attention-grabbing images/videos, your article was guaranteed to rank. If your competitors caught up to you, you would add more words. Rinse and repeat.\nThe system ran on for a while. A good number of web content writers got paid by the word and were incentivized to write more words. Businesses got to rank on the first page of Google, so they had no reason to change what worked. SEO experts and service providers were able to create a bloated and overpriced industry. But web users were getting the short end of the stick with fluffy, uninteresting, and arduous-to-read content that had forgotten who it was meant to serve.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t explicitly blame SEOs for the turn of events. Behind the scenes, Google has been focused on solving one problem: maximizing profit potential from ad revenue. Google was too busy stealing answers with featured snippets (later AI Overviews) from creators to notice the growing attention issue they had contributed to.\nAs early as 2019, savvy users discovered that adding ‘site:reddit.com’ or simply ‘Reddit’ to their searches was the best way to skip the ads and 2500-word articles to get the actual answer they were looking for. Perhaps if they had the resources, Reddit Inc. could have created a worthwhile competitor to Google Search. Google would later add a ‘Discussions and forums’ section in late 2022 and would begin boosting Reddit and Quora in 2023.\nIn his popular piece \"The Man Who Killed Google Search\", Ed Zitron posits a name he believes was responsible for the current of search: Prabhakar Raghavan. However, I am inclined to disagree. Scapegoats are very easy to find and the real problem likely runs much deeper. Let\u0026rsquo;s see who is behind that mask\nAt the end of the day, Google itself ruined Google Search, and the company has no current incentive to fix it.\nSo, what can we do about it? We can start by using Google\u0026rsquo;s proprietary products less, writing helpful content for people and promoting it actively. You can go a step further and install a custom ROM (LineageOS and /e/OS are good options) on your Android device to shake things up a bit.

Just like your software product needs to meet certain requirements, a landing page needs certain elements to be effective:\nPromise: A good landing page must offer a specific promise. This promise must be clear to the audience and address the exact problem they want to solve. Source: Shopify For example, the above landing page by Shopify promises lower costs and business growth. It communicates its message with few words and an eye-catching design.\nThe best B2B SaaS landing pages also have a hero image/section that shows the product in action. The prospect should be able to see themselves using your product’s features and getting results. In practice, this might be a screenshot of the software interface, a picture/illustration of a satisfied user, or a video explaining the benefits of the product. Actual pictures of people using the product are often more powerful.\nSource: Hubstaff Pictures of people tend to be more emotionally appealing than illustrations and visualizations. Research has shown that relevant images of real people can lead to a 95% increase in conversion rates .\nProof: Proof is also vital for a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page. It shows the prospect that you can deliver on the promise. The landing page should have hard numbers and testimonials that communicate your brand’s value. You are leaving money on the table without social proof. Source: Strikingly It is hard to sell a prospect who doesn’t trust you. Your proof should be prominently placed on the landing page, second only to your call to action.\nPull: A strong pull complements the previous two elements. You need an interesting lead magnet and a well-placed call-to-action button. Not every B2B landing page needs a lead magnet, though. If you offer a free trial and/or don’t request for credit card information at sign up, that is the lead magnet.\nSource: Wix canonicalURL: https://tomisinolujinmi.com/posts/who-ruined-search Your lead capture form should be simple and conducive to a frictionless signup. In some cases (enterprise SaaS, especially), you should collect enough information to qualify the lead effectively. If you have a product that has a long sales cycle, asking for just an email address might attract low-quality leads.\nThe goal is to reduce friction without affecting lead quality. You can skip the email funnel entirely and go straight to the sign up and onboarding process.\nBest practices for designing a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page Having the above elements in your landing page doesn’t guarantee that your conversion rates will go through the roof. To make a great meal, it is not enough to have the right ingredients. You need to have them in the right proportion.\nHere is a list of what it takes to create a high-converting landing page for a B2B SaaS audience\n1. Navigation is a no-no Navigation blurs the line between a landing page and a regular website page. It dilutes attention and weakens the emphasis of your campaign. While some big names do it, it is not a recommended practice.\nSource: Quickbooks A landing page should ideally have one link on it – the call-to-action. This is why you should never send traffic to your homepage and why having a dedicated landing page for each campaign cannot be overemphasized.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude a top navigation bar on the landing page Include a YouTube video (distracting and provides a click-away point) Have more than one call-to-action Do:\nHave a single call-to-action Use Wistia for demo videos, if needed Provide all relevant information on the landing page itself 2. Responsiveness and speed are not negotiable Source: Carrd A good landing page loads fast and looks good on all devices.

A good B2B landing page should focus on two parties: you and your target customer.\nSource: Zoho Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re at a high-end restaurant and instead of giving you the menu and letting you choose what you\u0026rsquo;d like to eat, the waiter starts talking about how this restaurant is much better than the one down the street. You\u0026rsquo;d probably encourage him to give you the menu and let you come to your own conclusion. It\u0026rsquo;s the same thing with selling B2B SaaS products.\nMost prospects don\u0026rsquo;t care about who you\u0026rsquo;re better than; they just want to get the best value.\nWhile there are no studies on the performance of AI-generated vs human-written copy, a landing page is no place, in my opinion, for the generic content LLMs are known for. AI-assisted copy is generally fine, as long as it feels personal and retains your tone of voice.\n4. A/B testing Always Be Testing. A/B testing, also known as split testing, tests two different versions of a page to see which performs best. With A/B testing, you can tweak different elements on your B2B SaaS landing page (headlines, product images, calls-to-action, etc) and see what makes a difference in overall conversions.\nHowever, be cautious of being hyper-focused on minor details at the expense of the big picture. The majority of copy and design choices will be driven by gut feeling, personal taste, and experience.\nA/B tests should be concentrated on the parts of the landing page that directly influence conversions: copy length, headlines, form fields, call-to-action and key visuals.\nThere are no set rules for A/B testing though.

But, do read on if you want to know why I have a gripe with AI overviews:\n1. They are not better than featured snippets AI Overviews feel like a poorly thought-out solution to a problem that doesn’t exist. It is a perfect example of a solution looking for a problem.\nSource: Ben Collins (X) Google already displayed featured snippets prominently at the top of SERPs and while webmasters complained for a while, it was generally seen as the cost of doing business with a profit-driven conglomerate. Google has now replaced the passable featured snippets with slower and far less accurate AI Overviews. It is a downgrade on several levels. I never thought I would miss featured snippets but here we are.\nGoogle Search has become a sorry state of affairs with AI-generated summaries of AI-generated content.\n2. The overviews are scraped content The root of the problem is Google’s decision to compete with publishers for clicks and traffic, similar to most social media platforms.\nGoogle went from being a search engine that allowed people to find interesting websites and articles to scraping the content and publishing it on their SERPs directly. Some people would argue web crawling and web scraping are completely different but I’d argue that there is only a fine distinction.\nGoogle didn’t become a web scraping service until it introduced schema markups which enhanced user experience but blurred the line between the publisher and the medium. They followed up with weather updates and live sports scores before going all in with featured snippets.\nGoogle has been scraping content and stealing traffic from publishers for a while. It is different now because AI Overviews only benefit the company and not the users.\nSoon, Google might stop showing websites entirely and simply display complete articles scraped from different sources .\n3. They are on by default I would be far less bothered with AI Overviews if Google made it easy to turn them off completely.\nThere is the Web (or “udm-14) workaround popularized by Ernie Smith of Tedium, but there is no official setting from Google that allows you to hide AI Overviews from searches across all devices.\nThe official reason is that Google knows what you want better than you do .\nAI Overviews always felt like a feature that Google was pressured to include. For the first time in the history of search, another search engine beat Google to the punch leveraging AI – technology that was a core part of Google’s business. The top guns panicked and had the teams push out a feature that was not close to being ready.\nIt is not exactly groundbreaking technology but it is enough to keep the movers and shakers happy. Turning it off would imply that Google was wrong to include in the first place and egos tend to fly sky high when you are as large as Google.\nTen blue links, how I\u0026rsquo;ve missed you\nThe “Web” results view is unburdened with AI results, for now. You can get a clean list of results by selecting Web from the menu at the bottom of the search bar or by adding “\u0026amp;udm-14” to the search URL. Ernie’s original blog post shows you how to set it up in your browser. TenBlueLinks and Ernie’s udm14 website can also be used as custom search engines. Enjoy it while it lasts.\nTip: You can add -ai to your search query for a quick fix\nSince the fiasco with the rocks and glue eating, Google has been more cautious with displaying AI Overviews. I’ve noticed AI Overviews appear more in informational searches and are less present in searches related to medicine (soon to be changed , finance, and politics. Due to how LLMs work, overviews also do not appear for breaking news or trending content.

While its competitors were cluttered, ad-ridden web portals, Google had one specific purpose, and it did it well.\nThis was what Google looked like then:\nSource: Google Search Blog Today, Google’s search engine is partly an AI chatbot and partly a portal to Reddit. Ads are displayed prominently above the fold. The top search results are fluffy, long-form content ranking primarily because of the number of keywords and backlinks on the page. Despite the company\u0026rsquo;s best efforts to convince us otherwise, Google cannot reliably infer content quality. Therefore, the algorithm has to make do with other less important and more easily faked signals.\nSince businesses started getting on the Web, it has been a dance between Google and SEOs with each end trying to get the better of the other. Google would release a new algorithm update and SEO experts would try to reverse-engineer it based on their observations and opinions.\nThese observations would become tactics and strategies, and if you had a website that relied on getting traffic from Google, you had to pay attention. Occasionally, Google would release a guide with some helpful tips and some intentionally vague advice like “Make your site interesting and useful.” The company encouraged search engine optimization, as long as you didn\u0026rsquo;t game the system. However, the simple truth is, that if there is a loophole, people will try to exploit it.\nSource: Google\u0026rsquo;s SEO Starter Guide There have several SEO techniques over the years, ranging from straight keyword stuffing to image tags. However, the most prevalent by far has been publishing long-form content. SEOs figured out that the most reliable way to rank high on Google was to write the best article on the topic.\nIt became common to see 2000+ word articles trying to cover every possible search intent with semantic keywords and unnecessary FAQ lists. Recipe pages would include long stories to convince the search algorithm that their content was the most in-depth and relevant. And the worst part (or best, depending on who you ask) is that it worked!\nIt worked because Google was too busy trying to keep the audience’s attention on the increasingly visible ads on the SERPs to ensure that webmasters were writing content for people and not their algorithm.\nBefore the Helpful Content update, if you wrote a 3000-word article filled with semantic keywords and attention-grabbing images/videos, your article was guaranteed to rank. If your competitors caught up to you, you would add more words. Rinse and repeat.\nThe system ran on for a while. A good number of web content writers got paid by the word and were incentivized to write more words. Businesses got to rank on the first page of Google, so they had no reason to change what worked. SEO experts and service providers were able to create a bloated and overpriced industry. But web users were getting the short end of the stick with fluffy, uninteresting, and arduous-to-read content that had forgotten who it was meant to serve.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t explicitly blame SEOs for the turn of events. Behind the scenes, Google has been focused on solving one problem: maximizing profit potential from ad revenue. Google was too busy stealing answers with featured snippets (later AI Overviews) from creators to notice the growing attention issue they had contributed to.\nAs early as 2019, savvy users discovered that adding ‘site:reddit.com’ or simply ‘Reddit’ to their searches was the best way to skip the ads and 2500-word articles to get the actual answer they were looking for. Perhaps if they had the resources, Reddit Inc. could have created a worthwhile competitor to Google Search. Google would later add a ‘Discussions and forums’ section in late 2022 and would begin boosting Reddit and Quora in 2023.\nIn his popular piece \"The Man Who Killed Google Search\", Ed Zitron posits a name he believes was responsible for the current of search: Prabhakar Raghavan. However, I am inclined to disagree. Scapegoats are very easy to find and the real problem likely runs much deeper. Let\u0026rsquo;s see who is behind that mask\nAt the end of the day, Google itself ruined Google Search, and the company has no current incentive to fix it.\nSo, what can we do about it? We can start by using Google\u0026rsquo;s proprietary products less, writing helpful content for people and promoting it actively. You can go a step further and install a custom ROM (LineageOS and /e/OS are good options) on your Android device to shake things up a bit. Between us and the LLM chatbots, I\u0026rsquo;d wager that we could go some damage to the conglomerate.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/who-ruined-search/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eGoogle displaced other search engines by leveraging a simple, minimalistic interface and superior search algorithm.

Having a domain name and hosting grants you your own tiny cranny of the Internet that you can completely lord over. Unlike a social media account, you can’t be de-platformed and you don’t really have to deal with people you don’t like. Everyone, I believe, should have at least a blog on their website. It is a plus if the website is self-hosted (although mine isn\u0026rsquo;t).\nWordPress is the most popular option for people who want to build their own website and it is a great option. It is free, powerful, and quite customizable. However, it is overkill for most purposes. For my website, I decided to forego a traditional content management system like WordPress and opt for a static site generator instead.\nA static website is easier and cheaper to host, offers a lot of granularity, and generally loads faster than a comparable dynamic website. Popular static site generators include Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, and Astro.\nMy first choice was Jekyll but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find suitable documentation and it all seemed unwieldy. So, I decided to go with Hugo instead. Hugo is a static site generator written in the Go language. It is indisputably the fastest SSG on the market.\nHugo requires three dependencies: Git, Go, and Sass. I have been spoiled by Windows operating system and I had to get used to working in the terminal. With some Googling, grit, and a little help from Perplexity, I started to get the hang of it.\nI installed the dependencies and by following the instructions in the Quickstart tutorial, I got my first static website up and running. Configuring the website involves changing the default settings in the hugo.toml (or yaml) file and adding new values. I added a theme, wrote some pages, and started putting this post together.\nI have learnt to use git commits to track changes and “back up” my website. I have also brushed my rusty HTML wrangling skills a bit. I understand the Jamstack appeal now.\nThe website isn’t complete yet as at the time of wrting but I am very happy with where it is currently and look forward to bringing my vision to life.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more about Hugo and how it works, check out the official website .

But web users were getting the short end of the stick with fluffy, uninteresting, and arduous-to-read content that had forgotten who it was meant to serve.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t explicitly blame SEOs for the turn of events. Behind the scenes, Google has been focused on solving one problem: maximizing profit potential from ad revenue. Google was too busy stealing answers with featured snippets (later AI Overviews) from creators to notice the growing attention issue they had contributed to.\nAs early as 2019, savvy users discovered that adding ‘site:reddit.com’ or simply ‘Reddit’ to their searches was the best way to skip the ads and 2500-word articles to get the actual answer they were looking for. Perhaps if they had the resources, Reddit Inc. could have created a worthwhile competitor to Google Search. Google would later add a ‘Discussions and forums’ section in late 2022 and would begin boosting Reddit and Quora in 2023.\nIn his popular piece \"The Man Who Killed Google Search\", Ed Zitron posits a name he believes was responsible for the current of search: Prabhakar Raghavan. However, I am inclined to disagree. Scapegoats are very easy to find and the real problem likely runs much deeper. Let\u0026rsquo;s see who is behind that mask\nAt the end of the day, Google itself ruined Google Search, and the company has no current incentive to fix it.\nSo, what can we do about it? We can start by using Google\u0026rsquo;s proprietary products less, writing helpful content for people and promoting it actively. You can go a step further and install a custom ROM (LineageOS and /e/OS are good options) on your Android device to shake things up a bit.

Having a domain name and hosting grants you your own tiny cranny of the Internet that you can completely lord over. Unlike a social media account, you can’t be de-platformed and you don’t really have to deal with people you don’t like. Everyone, I believe, should have at least a blog on their website. It is a plus if the website is self-hosted (although mine isn\u0026rsquo;t).\nWordPress is the most popular option for people who want to build their own website and it is a great option. It is free, powerful, and quite customizable. However, it is overkill for most purposes. For my website, I decided to forego a traditional content management system like WordPress and opt for a static site generator instead.\nA static website is easier and cheaper to host, offers a lot of granularity, and generally loads faster than a comparable dynamic website. Popular static site generators include Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, and Astro.\nMy first choice was Jekyll but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find suitable documentation and it all seemed unwieldy. So, I decided to go with Hugo instead. Hugo is a static site generator written in the Go language. It is indisputably the fastest SSG on the market.\nHugo requires three dependencies: Git, Go, and Sass. I have been spoiled by Windows operating system and I had to get used to working in the terminal. With some Googling, grit, and a little help from Perplexity, I started to get the hang of it.\nI installed the dependencies and by following the instructions in the Quickstart tutorial, I got my first static website up and running. Configuring the website involves changing the default settings in the hugo.toml (or yaml) file and adding new values. I added a theme, wrote some pages, and started putting this post together.\nI have learnt to use git commits to track changes and “back up” my website. I have also brushed my rusty HTML wrangling skills a bit. I understand the Jamstack appeal now.\nThe website isn’t complete yet as at the time of wrting but I am very happy with where it is currently and look forward to bringing my vision to life.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more about Hugo and how it works, check out the official website .

It is part of a specific marketing campaign (social, email, or search) and encourages visitors to take a single, targeted action.\nIt is a proven fact that landing pages are better for conversions than websites. Even if your product’s value proposition is laid out perfectly on your homepage and it fits the ad campaign, you should still use a landing page. Why? Unlike your homepage, a landing page (ideally) has one jumping off point: the call-to-action.\nAn oft-touted statistic from Unbounce says that they checked 455 pages and found that, on average, a dedicated landing page has a 65 percent higher conversion rate than website pages. We have no further information about the study though.\nA detailed case study by Instapage concluded that a dedicated landing page had a conversion rate almost three times (~300%) of a homepage, despite having a lower click-through rate.\nA B2B landing page’s primary purpose is to convert visitors into leads or customers with a promise. Therefore, a dedicated landing page often means higher conversions.\nElements of a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page All landing pages do not convert equally. Just like your software product needs to meet certain requirements, a landing page needs certain elements to be effective:\nPromise: A good landing page must offer a specific promise. This promise must be clear to the audience and address the exact problem they want to solve. Source: Shopify For example, the above landing page by Shopify promises lower costs and business growth. It communicates its message with few words and an eye-catching design.\nThe best B2B SaaS landing pages also have a hero image/section that shows the product in action. The prospect should be able to see themselves using your product’s features and getting results. In practice, this might be a screenshot of the software interface, a picture/illustration of a satisfied user, or a video explaining the benefits of the product. Actual pictures of people using the product are often more powerful.\nSource: Hubstaff Pictures of people tend to be more emotionally appealing than illustrations and visualizations. Research has shown that relevant images of real people can lead to a 95% increase in conversion rates .\nProof: Proof is also vital for a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page. It shows the prospect that you can deliver on the promise. The landing page should have hard numbers and testimonials that communicate your brand’s value. You are leaving money on the table without social proof. Source: Strikingly It is hard to sell a prospect who doesn’t trust you. Your proof should be prominently placed on the landing page, second only to your call to action.\nPull: A strong pull complements the previous two elements. You need an interesting lead magnet and a well-placed call-to-action button. Not every B2B landing page needs a lead magnet, though. If you offer a free trial and/or don’t request for credit card information at sign up, that is the lead magnet.\nSource: Wix Your lead capture form should be simple and conducive to a frictionless signup. In some cases (enterprise SaaS, especially), you should collect enough information to qualify the lead effectively. If you have a product that has a long sales cycle, asking for just an email address might attract low-quality leads.\nThe goal is to reduce friction without affecting lead quality. You can skip the email funnel entirely and go straight to the sign up and onboarding process.\nBest practices for designing a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page Having the above elements in your landing page doesn’t guarantee that your conversion rates will go through the roof. To make a great meal, it is not enough to have the right ingredients. You need to have them in the right proportion.\nHere is a list of what it takes to create a high-converting landing page for a B2B SaaS audience\n1. Navigation is a no-no Navigation blurs the line between a landing page and a regular website page. It dilutes attention and weakens the emphasis of your campaign. While some big names do it, it is not a recommended practice.\nSource: Quickbooks A landing page should ideally have one link on it – the call-to-action. This is why you should never send traffic to your homepage and why having a dedicated landing page for each campaign cannot be overemphasized.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude a top navigation bar on the landing page Include a YouTube video (distracting and provides a click-away point) Have more than one call-to-action Do:\nHave a single call-to-action Use Wistia for demo videos, if needed Provide all relevant information on the landing page itself 2. Responsiveness and speed are not negotiable Source: Carrd A good landing page loads fast and looks good on all devices. In 2024, Unbounce carried out a study of over 40000 landing pages and found out that 79% of SaaS landing page visits came from mobile devices.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness. If your website runs on WordPress, use a lightweight theme like Astra or GeneratePress and avoid page builders.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness. If your website runs on WordPress, use a lightweight theme like Astra or GeneratePress and avoid page builders.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude everything that has your brand or product’s name on it. Use large images Avoid WordPress page builders like Divi and Elementor (or use a caching plugin) Do:\nUse compressed images, preferably Webp Use a block editor for WordPress Test your page\u0026rsquo;s loading speed with PageSpeed Insights before publishing. 3. Clean, relevant copy complements great design Source: Mailchimp Good copy won\u0026rsquo;t save bad design. The landing page’s design is the first thing the prospect sees. If the design looks good and tenable, then they stick around to read the copy.\nThe copy should talk about your brand, not the competition. A landing page is not where you talk in detail about how your product is much better than the competition. A good B2B landing page should focus on two parties: you and your target customer.\nSource: Zoho Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re at a high-end restaurant and instead of giving you the menu and letting you choose what you\u0026rsquo;d like to eat, the waiter starts talking about how this restaurant is much better than the one down the street. You\u0026rsquo;d probably encourage him to give you the menu and let you come to your own conclusion. It\u0026rsquo;s the same thing with selling B2B SaaS products.\nMost prospects don\u0026rsquo;t care about who you\u0026rsquo;re better than; they just want to get the best value.\nWhile there are no studies on the performance of AI-generated vs human-written copy, a landing page is no place, in my opinion, for the generic content LLMs are known for. AI-assisted copy is generally fine, as long as it feels personal and retains your tone of voice.\n4. A/B testing \u0026ldquo;Always Be Testing\u0026rdquo;. A/B testing, also known as split testing, tests two different versions of a page to see which performs best. With A/B testing, you can tweak different elements on your B2B SaaS landing page (headlines, product images, calls-to-action, etc) and see what makes a difference in overall conversions.\nHowever, be cautious of being hyper-focused on minor details at the expense of the big picture. The majority of copy and design choices will be driven by gut feeling, personal taste, and experience.\nA/B tests should be concentrated on the parts of the landing page that directly influence conversions: copy length, headlines, form fields, call-to-action and key visuals.\nThere are no set rules for A/B testing though. Yourhttps://www.q personal experience and campaign goals should inform the tests you perform.\n5. Keep it simple Source: Brett White/Medium Unbounce’s 2024 Conversion Benchmark Report puts the conversion rate for SaaS landing pages at 3.8%, 42% lower than the industry average of 6.6%. SaaS landing pages are more likely to use complex copy than other industries, leaving prospects confused about the value proposition.\nCopy that is simple and easy to understand converts five times better.\nForget the industry jargon and verbose descriptions. If your product has advanced features that are difficult to explain, opt for a demo video and keep the copy stupid simple.\nIf you found this guide useful, feel free to share it!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/b2b-saas-landing-page/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA B2B SaaS landing page is a focused, standalone web page designed to convert business (B2B) prospects into leads or customers for a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product.

It is part of a specific marketing campaign (social, email, or search) and encourages visitors to take a single, targeted action.\nIt is a proven fact that landing pages are better for conversions than websites. Even if your product’s value proposition is laid out perfectly on your homepage and it fits the ad campaign, you should still use a landing page. Why? Unlike your homepage, a landing page (ideally) has one jumping off point: the call-to-action.\nAn oft-touted statistic from Unbounce says that they checked 455 pages and found that, on average, a dedicated landing page has a 65 percent higher conversion rate than website pages. We have no further information about the study though.\nA detailed case study by Instapage concluded that a dedicated landing page had a conversion rate almost three times (~300%) of a homepage, despite having a lower click-through rate.\nA B2B landing page’s primary purpose is to convert visitors into leads or customers with a promise. Therefore, a dedicated landing page often means higher conversions.\nElements of a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page All landing pages do not convert equally. Just like your software product needs to meet certain requirements, a landing page needs certain elements to be effective:\nPromise: A good landing page must offer a specific promise. This promise must be clear to the audience and address the exact problem they want to solve. Source: Shopify For example, the above landing page by Shopify promises lower costs and business growth. It communicates its message with few words and an eye-catching design.\nThe best B2B SaaS landing pages also have a hero image/section that shows the product in action. The prospect should be able to see themselves using your product’s features and getting results. In practice, this might be a screenshot of the software interface, a picture/illustration of a satisfied user, or a video explaining the benefits of the product. Actual pictures of people using the product are often more powerful.\nSource: Hubstaff Pictures of people tend to be more emotionally appealing than illustrations and visualizations. Research has shown that relevant images of real people can lead to a 95% increase in conversion rates .\nProof: Proof is also vital for a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page. It shows the prospect that you can deliver on the promise. The landing page should have hard numbers and testimonials that communicate your brand’s value. You are leaving money on the table without social proof. Source: Strikingly It is hard to sell a prospect who doesn’t trust you. Your proof should be prominently placed on the landing page, second only to your call to action.\nPull: A strong pull complements the previous two elements. You need an interesting lead magnet and a well-placed call-to-action button. Not every B2B landing page needs a lead magnet, though. If you offer a free trial and/or don’t request for credit card information at sign up, that is the lead magnet.\nSource: Wix Your lead capture form should be simple and conducive to a frictionless signup. In some cases (enterprise SaaS, especially), you should collect enough information to qualify the lead effectively. If you have a product that has a long sales cycle, asking for just an email address might attract low-quality leads.\nThe goal is to reduce friction without affecting lead quality. You can skip the email funnel entirely and go straight to the sign up and onboarding process.\nBest practices for designing a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page Having the above elements in your landing page doesn’t guarantee that your conversion rates will go through the roof. To make a great meal, it is not enough to have the right ingredients. You need to have them in the right proportion.\nHere is a list of what it takes to create a high-converting landing page for a B2B SaaS audience\n1. Navigation is a no-no Navigation blurs the line between a landing page and a regular website page. It dilutes attention and weakens the emphasis of your campaign. While some big names do it, it is not a recommended practice.\nSource: Quickbooks A landing page should ideally have one link on it – the call-to-action. This is why you should never send traffic to your homepage and why having a dedicated landing page for each campaign cannot be overemphasized.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude a top navigation bar on the landing page Include a YouTube video (distracting and provides a click-away point) Have more than one call-to-action Do:\nHave a single call-to-action Use Wistia for demo videos, if needed Provide all relevant information on the landing page itself 2. Responsiveness and speed are not negotiable Source: Carrd A good landing page loads fast and looks good on all devices. In 2024, Unbounce carried out a study of over 40000 landing pages and found out that 79% of SaaS landing page visits came from mobile devices.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness. If your website runs on WordPress, use a lightweight theme like Astra or GeneratePress and avoid page builders.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness. If your website runs on WordPress, use a lightweight theme like Astra or GeneratePress and avoid page builders.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude everything that has your brand or product’s name on it. Use large images Avoid WordPress page builders like Divi and Elementor (or use a caching plugin) Do:\nUse compressed images, preferably Webp Use a block editor for WordPress Test your page\u0026rsquo;s loading speed with PageSpeed Insights before publishing. 3. Clean, relevant copy complements great design Source: Mailchimp Good copy won\u0026rsquo;t save bad design. The landing page’s design is the first thing the prospect sees. If the design looks good and tenable, then they stick around to read the copy.\nThe copy should talk about your brand, not the competition. A landing page is not where you talk in detail about how your product is much better than the competition. A good B2B landing page should focus on two parties: you and your target customer.\nSource: Zoho Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re at a high-end restaurant and instead of giving you the menu and letting you choose what you\u0026rsquo;d like to eat, the waiter starts talking about how this restaurant is much better than the one down the street. You\u0026rsquo;d probably encourage him to give you the menu and let you come to your own conclusion. It\u0026rsquo;s the same thing with selling B2B SaaS products.\nMost prospects don\u0026rsquo;t care about who you\u0026rsquo;re better than; they just want to get the best value.\nWhile there are no studies on the performance of AI-generated vs human-written copy, a landing page is no place, in my opinion, for the generic content LLMs are known for. AI-assisted copy is generally fine, as long as it feels personal and retains your tone of voice.\n4. A/B testing \u0026ldquo;Always Be Testing\u0026rdquo;. A/B testing, also known as split testing, tests two different versions of a page to see which performs best. With A/B testing, you can tweak different elements on your B2B SaaS landing page (headlines, product images, calls-to-action, etc) and see what makes a difference in overall conversions.\nHowever, be cautious of being hyper-focused on minor details at the expense of the big picture. The majority of copy and design choices will be driven by gut feeling, personal taste, and experience.\nA/B tests should be concentrated on the parts of the landing page that directly influence conversions: copy length, headlines, form fields, call-to-action and key visuals.\nThere are no set rules for A/B testing though. Yourhttps://www.q personal experience and campaign goals should inform the tests you perform.\n5. Keep it simple Source: Brett White/Medium Unbounce’s 2024 Conversion Benchmark Report puts the conversion rate for SaaS landing pages at 3.8%, 42% lower than the industry average of 6.6%. SaaS landing pages are more likely to use complex copy than other industries, leaving prospects confused about the value proposition.\nCopy that is simple and easy to understand converts five times better.\nForget the industry jargon and verbose descriptions. If your product has advanced features that are difficult to explain, opt for a demo video and keep the copy stupid simple.\nIf you found this guide useful, please share it!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/b2b-saas-landing-page/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA B2B SaaS landing page is a focused, standalone web page designed to convert business (B2B) prospects into leads or customers for a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product.

They have taken over from featured snippets as Google’s latest attempt at keeping users on the SERP with zero-click searches.\nAI Overviews have become much better than when they first launched but I still think they are net negative on the search experience and are better off hidden away in a collapsible drop-down menu like People Also Ask.\nThat pretty much sums up my thoughts on AI Overviews. But, do read on if you want to know why I have a gripe with AI overviews:\n1. They are not better than featured snippets AI Overviews feel like a poorly thought-out solution to a problem that doesn’t exist. It is a perfect example of a solution looking for a problem.\nSource: Ben Collins (X) Google already displayed featured snippets prominently at the top of SERPs and while webmasters complained for a while, it was generally seen as the cost of doing business with a profit-driven conglomerate. Google has now replaced the passable featured snippets with slower and far less accurate AI Overviews. It is a downgrade on several levels. I never thought I would miss featured snippets but here we are.\nGoogle Search has become a sorry state of affairs with AI-generated summaries of AI-generated content.\n2. The overviews are scraped content The root of the problem is Google’s decision to compete with publishers for clicks and traffic, similar to most social media platforms.\nGoogle went from being a search engine that allowed people to find interesting websites and articles to scraping the content and publishing it on their SERPs directly. Some people would argue web crawling and web scraping are completely different but I’d argue that there is only a fine distinction.\nGoogle didn’t become a web scraping service until it introduced schema markups which enhanced user experience but blurred the line between the publisher and the medium. They followed up with weather updates and live sports scores before going all in with featured snippets.\nGoogle has been scraping content and stealing traffic from publishers for a while. It is different now because AI Overviews only benefit the company and not the users.\nSoon, Google might stop showing websites entirely and simply display complete articles scraped from different sources .\n3. They are on by default I would be far less bothered with AI Overviews if Google made it easy to turn them off completely.\nThere is the Web (or “udm-14) workaround popularized by Ernie Smith of Tedium, but there is no official setting from Google that allows you to hide AI Overviews from searches across all devices.\nThe official reason is that Google knows what you want better than you do .\nAI Overviews always felt like a feature that Google was pressured to include. For the first time in the history of search, another search engine beat Google to the punch leveraging AI – technology that was a core part of Google’s business. The top guns panicked and had the teams push out a feature that was not close to being ready.\nIt is not exactly groundbreaking technology but it is enough to keep the movers and shakers happy. Turning it off would imply that Google was wrong to include in the first place and egos tend to fly sky high when you are as large as Google.\nTen blue links, how I\u0026rsquo;ve missed you\nThe “Web” results view is unburdened with AI results, for now. You can get a clean list of results by selecting Web from the menu at the bottom of the search bar or by adding “\u0026amp;udm-14” to the search URL. Ernie’s original blog post shows you how to set it up in your browser. TenBlueLinks and Ernie’s udm14 website can also be used as custom search engines. Enjoy it while it lasts.\nTip: You can add -ai to your search query for a quick fix\nSince the fiasco with the rocks and glue eating, Google has been more cautious with displaying AI Overviews. I’ve noticed AI Overviews appear more in informational searches and are less present in searches related to medicine (soon to be changed , finance, and politics. Due to how LLMs work, overviews also do not appear for breaking news or trending content.

However, the most prevalent by far has been publishing long-form content. SEOs figured out that the most reliable way to rank high on Google was to write the best article on the topic.\nIt became common to see 2000+ word articles trying to cover every possible search intent with semantic keywords and unnecessary FAQ lists.

It is part of a specific marketing campaign (social, email, or search) and encourages visitors to take a single, targeted action.\nIt is a proven fact that landing pages are better for conversions than websites. Even if your product’s value proposition is laid out perfectly on your homepage and it fits the ad campaign, you should still use a landing page. Why? Unlike your homepage, a landing page (ideally) has one jumping off point: the call-to-action.\nAn oft-touted statistic from Unbounce says that they checked 455 pages and found that, on average, a dedicated landing page has a 65 percent higher conversion rate than website pages. We have no further information about the study though.\nA detailed case study by Instapage concluded that a dedicated landing page had a conversion rate almost three times (~300%) of a homepage, despite having a lower click-through rate.\nA B2B landing page’s primary purpose is to convert visitors into leads or customers with a promise. Therefore, a dedicated landing page often means higher conversions.\nElements of a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page All landing pages do not convert equally. Just like your software product needs to meet certain requirements, a landing page needs certain elements to be effective:\nPromise: A good landing page must offer a specific promise. This promise must be clear to the audience and address the exact problem they want to solve. Source: Shopify For example, the above landing page by Shopify promises lower costs and business growth. It communicates its message with few words and an eye-catching design.\nThe best B2B SaaS landing pages also have a hero image/section that shows the product in action. The prospect should be able to see themselves using your product’s features and getting results. In practice, this might be a screenshot of the software interface, a picture/illustration of a satisfied user, or a video explaining the benefits of the product. Actual pictures of people using the product are often more powerful.\nSource: Hubstaff Pictures of people tend to be more emotionally appealing than illustrations and visualizations. Research has shown that relevant images of real people can lead to a 95% increase in conversion rates .\nProof: Proof is also vital for a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page. It shows the prospect that you can deliver on the promise. The landing page should have hard numbers and testimonials that communicate your brand’s value. You are leaving money on the table without social proof. Source: Strikingly It is hard to sell a prospect who doesn’t trust you. Your proof should be prominently placed on the landing page, second only to your call to action.\nPull: A strong pull complements the previous two elements. You need an interesting lead magnet and a well-placed call-to-action button. Not every B2B landing page needs a lead magnet, though. If you offer a free trial and/or don’t request for credit card information at sign up, that is the lead magnet.\nSource: Wix Your lead capture form should be simple and conducive to a frictionless signup. In some cases (enterprise SaaS, especially), you should collect enough information to qualify the lead effectively. If you have a product that has a long sales cycle, asking for just an email address might attract low-quality leads.\nThe goal is to reduce friction without affecting lead quality. You can skip the email funnel entirely and go straight to the sign up and onboarding process.\nBest practices for designing a high-converting B2B SaaS landing page Having the above elements in your landing page doesn’t guarantee that your conversion rates will go through the roof. To make a great meal, it is not enough to have the right ingredients. You need to have them in the right proportion.\nHere is a list of what it takes to create a high-converting landing page for a B2B SaaS audience\n1. Navigation is a no-no Navigation blurs the line between a landing page and a regular website page. It dilutes attention and weakens the emphasis of your campaign. While some big names do it, it is not a recommended practice.\nSource: Quickbooks A landing page should ideally have one link on it – the call-to-action. This is why you should never send traffic to your homepage and why having a dedicated landing page for each campaign cannot be overemphasized.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude a top navigation bar on the landing page Include a YouTube video (distracting and provides a click-away point) Have more than one call-to-action Do:\nHave a single call-to-action Use Wistia for demo videos, if needed Provide all relevant information on the landing page itself 2. Responsiveness and speed are not negotiable Source: Carrd A good landing page loads fast and looks good on all devices. In 2024, Unbounce carried out a study of over 40000 landing pages and found out that 79% of SaaS landing page visits came from mobile devices.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness. If your website runs on WordPress, use a lightweight theme like Astra or GeneratePress and avoid page builders.\nMost SaaS landing page builders like Unbounce, Framer, and Carrd, are already optimized for speed and responsiveness. If your website runs on WordPress, use a lightweight theme like Astra or GeneratePress and avoid page builders.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t:\nInclude everything that has your brand or product’s name on it. Use large images Avoid WordPress page builders like Divi and Elementor (or use a caching plugin) Do:\nUse compressed images, preferably Webp Use a block editor for WordPress Test your page\u0026rsquo;s loading speed with PageSpeed Insights before publishing. 3. Clean, relevant copy complements great design Source: Mailchimp Good copy won\u0026rsquo;t save bad design. The landing page’s design is the first thing the prospect sees. If the design looks good and tenable, then they stick around to read the copy.\nThe copy should talk about your brand, not the competition. A landing page is not where you talk in detail about how your product is much better than the competition. A good B2B landing page should focus on two parties: you and your target customer.\nSource: Zoho Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re at a high-end restaurant and instead of giving you the menu and letting you choose what you\u0026rsquo;d like to eat, the waiter starts talking about how this restaurant is much better than the one down the street. You\u0026rsquo;d probably encourage him to give you the menu and let you come to your own conclusion. It\u0026rsquo;s the same thing with selling B2B SaaS products.\nMost prospects don\u0026rsquo;t care about who you\u0026rsquo;re better than; they just want to get the best value.\nWhile there are no studies on the performance of AI-generated vs human-written copy, a landing page is no place, in my opinion, for the generic content LLMs are known for. AI-assisted copy is generally fine, as long as it feels personal and retains your tone of voice.\n4. A/B testing \u0026ldquo;Always Be Testing\u0026rdquo;. A/B testing, also known as split testing, tests two different versions of a page to see which performs best. With A/B testing, you can tweak different elements on your B2B SaaS landing page (headlines, product images, calls-to-action, etc) and see what makes a difference in overall conversions.\nHowever, be cautious of being hyper-focused on minor details at the expense of the big picture. The majority of copy and design choices will be driven by gut feeling, personal taste, and experience.\nA/B tests should be concentrated on the parts of the landing page that directly influence conversions: copy length, headlines, form fields, call-to-action and key visuals.\nThere are no set rules for A/B testing though. Yourhttps://www.q personal experience and campaign goals should inform the tests you perform.\n5. Keep it simple Source: Brett White/Medium Unbounce’s 2024 Conversion Benchmark Report puts the conversion rate for SaaS landing pages at 3.8%, 42% lower than the industry average of 6.6%. SaaS landing pages are more likely to use complex copy than other industries, leaving prospects confused about the value proposition.\nCopy that is simple and easy to understand converts five times better.\nForget the industry jargon and verbose descriptions. If your product has advanced features that are difficult to explain, opt for a demo video and keep the copy stupid simple.\nIf you found this guide useful, please share it!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/b2b-saas-landing-page/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA B2B SaaS landing page is a focused, standalone web page designed to convert business (B2B) prospects into leads or customers for a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product.

They have taken over from featured snippets as Google’s latest attempt at keeping users on the SERP with zero-click searches.\nAI Overviews have become much better than when they first launched but I still think they are net negative on the search experience and are better off hidden away in a collapsible drop-down menu like People Also Ask.\nThat pretty much sums up my thoughts on AI Overviews. But, do read on if you want to know why I have a gripe with AI overviews:\n1. They are not better than featured snippets AI Overviews feel like a poorly thought-out solution to a problem that doesn’t exist. It is a perfect example of a solution looking for a problem.\nSource: Ben Collins (X) Google already displayed featured snippets prominently at the top of SERPs and while webmasters complained for a while, it was generally seen as the cost of doing business with a profit-driven conglomerate. Google has now replaced the passable featured snippets with slower and far less accurate AI Overviews. It is a downgrade on several levels. I never thought I would miss featured snippets but here we are.\nGoogle Search has become a sorry state of affairs with AI-generated summaries of AI-generated content.\n2. The overviews are scraped content The root of the problem is Google’s decision to compete with publishers for clicks and traffic, similar to most social media platforms.\nGoogle went from being a search engine that allowed people to find interesting websites and articles to scraping the content and publishing it on their SERPs directly. Some people would argue web crawling and web scraping are completely different but I’d argue that there is only a fine distinction.\nGoogle didn’t become a web scraping service until it introduced schema markups which enhanced user experience but blurred the line between the publisher and the medium. They followed up with weather updates and live sports scores before going all in with featured snippets.\nGoogle has been scraping content and stealing traffic from publishers for a while. It is different now because AI Overviews only benefit the company and not the users.\nSoon, Google might stop showing websites entirely and simply display complete articles scraped from different sources .\n3. They are on by default I would be far less bothered with AI Overviews if Google made it easy to turn them off completely.\nThere is the Web (or “udm-14) workaround popularized by Ernie Smith of Tedium, but there is no official setting from Google that allows you to hide AI Overviews from searches across all devices.\nThe official reason is that Google knows what you want better than you do .\nAI Overviews always felt like a feature that Google was pressured to include. For the first time in the history of search, another search engine beat Google to the punch leveraging AI – technology that was a core part of Google’s business. The top guns panicked and had the teams push out a feature that was not close to being ready.\nIt is not exactly groundbreaking technology but it is enough to keep the movers and shakers happy. Turning it off would imply that Google was wrong to include in the first place and egos tend to fly sky high when you are as large as Google.\nTen blue links, how I\u0026rsquo;ve missed you\nThe “Web” results view is unburdened with AI results, for now. You can get a clean list of results by selecting Web from the menu at the bottom of the search bar or by adding “\u0026amp;udm-14” to the search URL. Ernie’s original blog post shows you how to set it up in your browser. TenBlueLinks and Ernie’s udm14 website can also be used as custom search engines. Enjoy it while it lasts.\nTip: You can add -ai to your search query for a quick fix\nSince the fiasco with the rocks and glue eating, Google has been more cautious with displaying AI Overviews. I’ve noticed AI Overviews appear more in informational searches and are less present in searches related to medicine (soon to be changed , finance, and politics. Due to how LLMs work, overviews also do not appear for breaking news or trending content. So, it is not the end of the world as we know it, not quite yet.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/problem-with-ai-overviews/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAccording to Search Engine Land, AI Oveviews appear in \u003ca href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-ai-overviews-found-in-74-of-problem-solving-queries/538504/\"   target=\"_blank\"\u003e74% of “problem-solving” queries\u003c/a\u003e\n.

While its competitors were cluttered, ad-ridden web portals, Google had one specific purpose, and it did it well.\nThis was what Google looked like then:\nSource: Google Search Blog Today, Google’s search engine is partly an AI chatbot and partly a portal to Reddit. Ads are displayed prominently above the fold. The top search results are fluffy, long-form content ranking primarily because of the number of keywords and backlinks on the page. Despite the company\u0026rsquo;s best efforts to convince us otherwise, Google cannot reliably infer content quality. Therefore, the algorithm has to make do with other less important and more easily faked signals.\nSince businesses started getting on the Web, it has been a dance between Google and SEOs with each end trying to get the better of the other. Google would release a new algorithm update and SEO experts would try to reverse-engineer it based on their observations and opinions.\nThese observations would become tactics and strategies, and if you had a website that relied on getting traffic from Google, you had to pay attention. Occasionally, Google would release a guide with some helpful tips and some intentionally vague advice like “Make your site interesting and useful.” The company encouraged search engine optimization, as long as you didn\u0026rsquo;t game the system. However, the simple truth is, that if there is a loophole, people will try to exploit it.\nSource: Google\u0026rsquo;s SEO Starter Guide There have several SEO techniques over the years, ranging from straight keyword stuffing to image tags. However, the most prevalent by far has been publishing long-form content. SEOs figured out that the most reliable way to rank high on Google was to write the best article on the topic.\nIt became common to see 2000+ word articles trying to cover every possible search intent with semantic keywords and unnecessary FAQ lists. Recipe pages would include long stories to convince the search algorithm that their content was the most in-depth and relevant. And the worst part (or best, depending on who you ask) is that it worked!\nIt worked because Google was too busy trying to keep the audience’s attention on the increasingly visible ads on the SERPs to ensure that webmasters were writing content for people and not their algorithm.\nBefore the Helpful Content update, if you wrote a 3000-word article filled with semantic keywords and attention-grabbing images/videos, your article was guaranteed to rank. If your competitors caught up to you, you would add more words. Rinse and repeat.\nThe system ran on for a while. A good number of web content writers got paid by the word and were incentivized to write more words. Businesses got to rank on the first page of Google, so they had no reason to change what worked. SEO experts and service providers were able to create a bloated and overpriced industry. But web users were getting the short end of the stick with fluffy, uninteresting, and arduous-to-read content that had forgotten who it was meant to serve.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t explicitly blame SEOs for the turn of events. Behind the scenes, Google has been focused on solving one problem: maximizing profit potential from ad revenue. Google was too busy stealing answers with featured snippets (later AI Overviews) from creators to notice the growing attention issue they had contributed to.\nAs early as 2019, savvy users discovered that adding ‘site:reddit.com’ or simply ‘Reddit’ to their searches was the best way to skip the ads and 2500-word articles to get the actual answer they were looking for. Perhaps if they had the resources, Reddit Inc. could have created a worthwhile competitor to Google Search. Google would later add a ‘Discussions and forums’ section in late 2022 and would begin boosting Reddit and Quora in 2023.\nIn his popular piece \"The Man Who Killed Google Search\", Ed Zitron posits a name he believes was responsible for the current of search: Prabhakar Raghavan. However, I am inclined to disagree. Scapegoats are very easy to find and the real problem likely runs much deeper. Let\u0026rsquo;s see who is behind that mask\nAt the end of the day, Google itself ruined Google Search, and the company has no current incentive to fix it.\nSo, what can we do about it? We can start by using Google\u0026rsquo;s proprietary products less, writing helpful content for people and promoting it actively. You can go a step further and install a custom ROM (LineageOS and /e/OS are good options) on your Android device to shake things up a bit. Between us and the LLM chatbots, I\u0026rsquo;d wager that we could go some damage to the conglomerate.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/who-ruined-search/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eGoogle displaced other search engines by leveraging a simple, minimalistic interface and superior search algorithm.

Having a domain name and hosting grants you your own tiny cranny of the Internet that you can completely lord over. Unlike a social media account, you can’t be de-platformed and you don’t really have to deal with people you don’t like. Everyone, I believe, should have at least a blog on their website. It is a plus if the website is self-hosted (although mine isn\u0026rsquo;t).\nWordPress is the most popular option for people who want to build their own website and it is a great option. It is free, powerful, and quite customizable. However, it is overkill for most purposes. For my website, I decided to forego a traditional content management system like WordPress and opt for a static site generator instead.\nA static website is easier and cheaper to host, offers a lot of granularity, and generally loads faster than a comparable dynamic website. Popular static site generators include Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, and Astro.\nMy first choice was Jekyll but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find suitable documentation and it all seemed unwieldy. So, I decided to go with Hugo instead. Hugo is a static site generator written in the Go language. It is indisputably the fastest SSG on the market.\nHugo requires three dependencies: Git, Go, and Sass. I have been spoiled by Windows operating system and I had to get used to working in the terminal. With some Googling, grit, and a little help from Perplexity, I started to get the hang of it.\nI installed the dependencies and by following the instructions in the Quickstart tutorial, I got my first static website up and running. Configuring the website involves changing the default settings in the hugo.toml (or yaml) file and adding new values. I added a theme, wrote some pages, and started putting this post together.\nI have learnt to use git commits to track changes and “back up” my website. I have also brushed my rusty HTML wrangling skills a bit. I understand the Jamstack appeal now.\nThe website isn’t complete yet as at the time of wrting but I am very happy with where it is currently and look forward to bringing my vision to life.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more about Hugo and how it works, check out the official website .
