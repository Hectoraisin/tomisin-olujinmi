[{"content":"According to Search Engine Land, AI Oveviews appear in 74% of “problem-solving” queries . They have taken over from featured snippets as Google’s latest attempt at keeping users on the SERP with zero-click searches.\nAI Overviews have become much better than when they first launched but I still think they are net negative on the search experience and are better off hidden away in a collapsible drop-down menu like People Also Ask.\nThat pretty much sums up my thoughts on AI Overviews. But, do read on if you want to know why I have a gripe with AI overviews:\n1. They are not better than featured snippets AI Overviews feel like a poorly thought-out solution to a problem that doesn’t exist. It is a perfect example of a solution looking for a problem.\nSource: Ben Collins (X) Google already displayed featured snippets prominently at the top of SERPs and while webmasters complained for a while, it was generally seen as the cost of doing business with a profit-driven conglomerate. Google has now replaced the passable featured snippets with slower and far less accurate AI Overviews. It is a downgrade on several levels. I never thought I would miss featured snippets but here we are.\nGoogle Search has become a sorry state of affairs with AI-generated summaries of AI-generated content.\n2. The overviews are scraped content The root of the problem is Google’s decision to compete with publishers for clicks and traffic, similar to most social media platforms.\nGoogle went from being a search engine that allowed people to find interesting websites and articles to scraping the content and publishing it on their SERPs directly. Some people would argue web crawling and web scraping are completely different but I’d argue that there is only a fine distinction.\nGoogle didn’t become a web scraping service until it introduced schema markups which enhanced user experience but blurred the line between the publisher and the medium. They followed up with weather updates and live sports scores before going all in with featured snippets.\nGoogle has been scraping content and stealing traffic from publishers for a while. It is different now because AI Overviews only benefit the company and not the users.\nSoon, Google might stop showing websites entirely and simply display complete articles scraped from different sources .\n3. They are on by default I would be far less bothered with AI Overviews if Google made it easy to turn them off completely.\nThere is the Web (or “udm-14) workaround popularized by Ernie Smith of Tedium, but there is no official setting from Google that allows you to hide AI Overviews from searches across all devices.\nThe official reason is that Google knows what you want better than you do .\nAI Overviews always felt like a feature that Google was pressured to include. For the first time in the history of search, another search engine beat Google to the punch leveraging AI – technology that was a core part of Google’s business. The top guns panicked and had the teams push out a feature that was not close to being ready.\nIt is not exactly groundbreaking technology but it is enough to keep the movers and shakers happy. Turning it off would imply that Google was wrong to include in the first place and egos tend to fly sky high when you are as large as Google.\nTen blue links, how I\u0026rsquo;ve missed you\nThe “Web” results view is unburdened with AI results, for now. You can get a clean list of results by selecting Web from the menu at the bottom of the search bar or by adding “\u0026amp;udm-14” to the search URL. Ernie’s original blog post shows you how to set it up in your browser. TenBlueLinks and Ernie’s udm14 website can also be used as custom search engines. Enjoy it while it lasts.\nTip: You can add -ai to your search query for a quick fix\nSince the fiasco with the rocks and glue eating, Google has been more cautious with displaying AI Overviews. I’ve noticed AI Overviews appear more in informational searches and are less present in searches related to medicine (soon to be changed , finance, and politics. Due to how LLMs work, overviews also do not appear for breaking news or trending content. So, it is not the end of the world as we know it, not quite yet.\n","permalink":"https://tomisinolujinmi.com/posts/problem-with-ai-overviews/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAccording to Search Engine Land, AI Oveviews appear in \u003ca href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-ai-overviews-found-in-74-of-problem-solving-queries/538504/\"   target=\"_blank\"\u003e74% of “problem-solving” queries\u003c/a\u003e\n.

While its competitors were cluttered, ad-ridden web portals, Google had one specific purpose, and it did it well.\nThis was what Google looked like then:\nSource: Google Search Blog Today, Google’s search engine is partly an AI chatbot and partly a portal to Reddit. Ads are displayed prominently above the fold. The top search results are fluffy, long-form content ranking primarily because of the number of keywords and backlinks on the page. Despite the company\u0026rsquo;s best efforts to convince us otherwise, Google cannot reliably infer content quality. Therefore, the algorithm has to make do with other less important and more easily faked signals.\nSince businesses started getting on the Web, it has been a dance between Google and SEOs with each end trying to get the better of the other. Google would release a new algorithm update and SEO experts would try to reverse-engineer it based on their observations and opinions.\nThese observations would become tactics and strategies, and if you had a website that relied on getting traffic from Google, you had to pay attention. Occasionally, Google would release a guide with some helpful tips and some intentionally vague advice like “Make your site interesting and useful.” The company encouraged search engine optimization, as long as you didn\u0026rsquo;t game the system. However, the simple truth is, that if there is a loophole, people will try to exploit it.\nSource: Google\u0026rsquo;s SEO Starter Guide There have several SEO techniques over the years, ranging from straight keyword stuffing to image tags. However, the most prevalent by far has been publishing long-form content. SEOs figured out that the most reliable way to rank high on Google was to write the best article on the topic.\nIt became common to see 2000+ word articles trying to cover every possible search intent with semantic keywords and unnecessary FAQ lists. Recipe pages would include long stories to convince the search algorithm that their content was the most in-depth and relevant. And the worst part (or best, depending on who you ask) is that it worked!\nIt worked because Google was too busy trying to keep the audience’s attention on the increasingly visible ads on the SERPs to ensure that webmasters were writing content for people and not their algorithm.\nBefore the Helpful Content update, if you wrote a 3000-word article filled with semantic keywords and attention-grabbing images/videos, your article was guaranteed to rank. If your competitors caught up to you, you would add more words. Rinse and repeat.\nThe system ran on for a while. A good number of web content writers got paid by the word and were incentivized to write more words. Businesses got to rank on the first page of Google, so they had no reason to change what worked. SEO experts and service providers were able to create a bloated and overpriced industry. But web users were getting the short end of the stick with fluffy, uninteresting, and arduous-to-read content that had forgotten who it was meant to serve.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t explicitly blame SEOs for the turn of events. Behind the scenes, Google has been focused on solving one problem: maximizing profit potential from ad revenue. Google was too busy stealing answers with featured snippets (later AI Overviews) from creators to notice the growing attention issue they had contributed to.\nAs early as 2019, savvy users discovered that adding ‘site:reddit.com’ or simply ‘Reddit’ to their searches was the best way to skip the ads and 2500-word articles to get the actual answer they were looking for. Perhaps if they had the resources, Reddit Inc. could have created a worthwhile competitor to Google Search. Google would later add a ‘Discussions and forums’ section in late 2022 and would begin boosting Reddit and Quora in 2023.\nIn his popular piece \"The Man Who Killed Google Search\", Ed Zitron posits a name he believes was responsible for the current of search: Prabhakar Raghavan. However, I am inclined to disagree. Scapegoats are very easy to find and the real problem likely runs much deeper. Let\u0026rsquo;s see who is behind that mask\nAt the end of the day, Google itself ruined Google Search, and the company has no current incentive to fix it.\nSo, what can we do about it? We can start by using Google\u0026rsquo;s proprietary products less, writing helpful content for people and promoting it actively. You can go a step further and install a custom ROM (LineageOS and /e/OS are good options) on your Android device to shake things up a bit. Between us and the LLM chatbots, I\u0026rsquo;d wager that we could go some damage to the conglomerate.\n","permalink":"https://tomisinolujinmi.com/posts/who-ruined-search/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eGoogle displaced other search engines by leveraging a simple, minimalistic interface and superior search algorithm.

Having a domain name and hosting grants you your own tiny cranny of the Internet that you can completely lord over. Unlike a social media account, you can’t be de-platformed and you don’t really have to deal with people you don’t like. Everyone, I believe, should have at least a blog on their website. It is a plus if the website is self-hosted (although mine isn\u0026rsquo;t).\nWordPress is the most popular option for people who want to build their own website and it is a great option. It is free, powerful, and quite customizable. However, it is overkill for most purposes. For my website, I decided to forego a traditional content management system like WordPress and opt for a static site generator instead.\nA static website is easier and cheaper to host, offers a lot of granularity, and generally loads faster than a comparable dynamic website. Popular static site generators include Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, and Astro.\nMy first choice was Jekyll but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find suitable documentation and it all seemed unwieldy. So, I decided to go with Hugo instead. Hugo is a static site generator written in the Go language. It is indisputably the fastest SSG on the market.\nHugo requires three dependencies: Git, Go, and Sass. I have been spoiled by Windows operating system and I had to get used to working in the terminal. With some Googling, grit, and a little help from Perplexity, I started to get the hang of it.\nI installed the dependencies and by following the instructions in the Quickstart tutorial, I got my first static website up and running. Configuring the website involves changing the default settings in the hugo.toml (or yaml) file and adding new values. I added a theme, wrote some pages, and started putting this post together.\nI have learnt to use git commits to track changes and “back up” my website. I have also brushed my rusty HTML wrangling skills a bit. I understand the Jamstack appeal now.\nThe website isn’t complete yet as at the time of wrting but I am very happy with where it is currently and look forward to bringing my vision to life.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more about Hugo and how it works, check out the official website .
